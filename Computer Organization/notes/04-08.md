### pipeline

recap
- datapath & control
    - opcode to determine operation, generate control signals(state elements: Reg/Mem R/W, notice no RegRead signal; Mul: RegDst, AluSrc, MemReg, PcSrc; ALU: ALUop)
    - ALUop plus the func sent to ALU control, to generate ALUcontrol signal
        - ALUop: first bit is NOR, second is bnegate, last two are sent to MUX in ALUs
- don't care term
    - data but not information
    - treat as one in K-map

control signals
- truth table..don't care term in outputs
- jr and jal...how to implement
