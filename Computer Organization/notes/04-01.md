### single processor: datapath

recap
- division algorithm
    - shift left one bit at the beginning: always get a zero otherwise
    - correction step at the end for the additional shifting at the beginning
    - div $s0, $s1, mflo(quotient), mfhi(remainder)
    - signed divition: do unsigned version, the remainder follow the sign of the dividend
- floating point
    - guard bit and round bit

single-cycle implementation
- a subset of instructions: lw/sw, arithmetic, logic instructions
- instructions execution: fetch -> decode(read source register at the same time) -> perform the operation -> memory access -> write back the result
    - fetch: instructions in the instruction memory
        - PC -> +4 -> PC
    - decode: read two registers and decode the instruction
    - perform: ALU
    - memory access: data memory
    - write back: registers
