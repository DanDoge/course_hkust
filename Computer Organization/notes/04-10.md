### pipelined processor

pipeline analogy
- executing time not optimized, but throughput increased
- ideally, tasks should be independent
- potential speedup = # of pipeline stages
- no overlap of any stages
- may increase execution time by overhead and aligning the stages

MIPS pipeline
- instrution fetch, instrution decoding, execution, memory access, write back
- ideal pipeline: assume independent instrutions, equal time of stages
- additional pipeline registers: IF/ID, ID/EX, EX/MEM, MEM/WB
- single-clock-cycle pipeline diagram
- multi-clock-cycle pipeline diagram
- forward necessary infromation which will be used later, for the data will be overwritten by other instrutions
- control signals
    - IF: no signals
    - ID: no signals
    - EX: RegDst, ALUOp, ALUSrc
    - MEM: Branch, MemRead, MemWrite
    - WB: MemToReg, REgWrite
    - generate control signal at ID stage, carry only ones necessary along the pipeline

pipeline hazard
- e.g.

```assembly
lw $1, address
sw $3, $3, $1

bne $1, $2, target
add $3, $4, $5
```
- pipeline not fully filled
- strutual hazard(hardware caused, solved by separate instrution and data memory(hazard between MEM and IF), write in the first half, read in the second(hazard between WB and ID)), data, hazard, control hazard
    - can be resolved by waiting, but slow down the pipeline
