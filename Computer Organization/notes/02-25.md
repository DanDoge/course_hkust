### instructions

recap
- S-latch, D-latch, D filp-flop
- unsigned and signed intergers, 2's complement -> s.t. a - b ==> a + (-b)
- overflow, underflow
- zero / sign extension
- floating number, 1 + 8 + 23, 1 + 11 + 52
- why bias? compare floating numbers same as comparing intergers

reserved for exponent: 00000000, and 11111111
- if do not consider reserved value
    - smallest value: 0 00000001 0...0
- 00000000
    - underflow, to represent exect zero
    - (-1)^{s} * 0.F * 2^{-126}, still keep the continuity
- 11111111
    - if significant == 0, +/- infinity
    - if not, NaN

char
- original ASCII, seven bits, and leave the MSB 0

exam: pp. 34

instructions -> instructions set -> assemble language(by programmer) -> machine language(computer can understand)
- ISA: data types, instructions, registers, addressing modes, memory architecture, interrupt and execption handing, external IO
- new hardware can run old programm according to the same ISA
- MIPS: microprocessor, without interlocked pipeline stages
- mips data green card, provided in exam
- assembly define by assembler, but diff. assemble language may be suitable for a ISA
- RISC
    - simple, faster, regularity, common case fast
