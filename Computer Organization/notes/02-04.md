### intro. to digital logic

recap
- dec to hex to bin
- size: 1024, freq. 1000
- from high level lang. to mathine code
- isa
- five components of comp.

bits
- diff. voltage repersent diff. values: high(2.4-2.9, 1), low(0-0.5, 0), not perfect, not exactly 2.9 or 0
- conbining bits to repersent numbers / instructions, defined by ISA -> need to specify data type

truth table
- bin. var. -> take 2 values, 0 or 1
- input and output

logical circuits -> boolean algebra: desired behavior => truth table => logic function(expressed by truth table, logical expressions, K-map)
- boolean variable: 0 or 1
- logic operations: and or not, nand, nor, xor; functions complete
    - not: c = \overbar{a}
    - and: c = a * b
    - or: c = a + b
    - nand: c = not(and(a, b))
    - nor: c = not(or(a, b))
    - xor: c = a \circleplus b
- logic gates
- two types: combinational logic circuits(output depends only on input) / sequential logic circuits(have memory, output depends on input and state)
    simple combinational logical circuits
    - multiplexer: selects one of the inputs
    - decoder: n-to-2^n decoder, like a one-hot endeoder, used to select things from memory lines



e.g. half adder
- S = a xor b, c = a and b
