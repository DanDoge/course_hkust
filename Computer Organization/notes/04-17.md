### pipeline with hazard

recap
- three type of hazards
- forward and branch prediction

dependencies and forwarding
- detect data dependency: register id being equal
    - only if we are going to write into a register: check EX/MEM.RegWrite and MEM/WB.RegWrite
    - and only if Rd is not $zero: check EX/MEM / MEM/WB.registerRd != 0
- add some MUXes and a forwarding control unit
- e.g. double data hazard -> both hazard happen! which value to sned forward? the newest

```assembly
add $1, $1, $2
add $1, $1, $3
add $1, $1, $4
```

- load-use hazard
    - check register id and instruction type(MemRead)
- how to stall the pipeline
    - force values in ID/EX register to 0
    - prevent update of PC and IF/ID register
    - add a hazard detection unit: IF/ID write and PC write signal
- branch hazards
    - earliest time able to determine whether to jump: end of ID stage
    - add a adder, a comparier, then flush IF/ID if we should jump
- data hazard for branches
    - hazard for reg $4(not reg $1, which can be forwarded using existing forward path)
    ```assembly
    add $1, $2, $3
    add $4, $5, $6
    beq $1, $4, target
    ```
    - addd a new forward path from EX/MEM to ID stage, stall beq for one clock cycle
    - but still hazard!
    ```assembly
    lw $1, addr
    beq $1, $0, target
    ```
    - stall for two cycles!
- dynamic prediction: branch buffer, record recent branches' outcome
