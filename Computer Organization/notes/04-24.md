### memory system

recap
- structure hazard: hardware solution
- data hazard: forward datapath, re-order instructions
- control hazard: guess no jump
    - and determine jump decision as soon as ID stage
    - what if lw + beq?
- forwarding conditions: on lecture notes
    - check on reg $zero!
    - what if both hazard occur?
        - use the nearest value
- insert zero when inserting a bubble

memory hierarchy
- registers -> cache -> main memory -> secondary stroage
- dram: capasitor holding data, transister control io operations
    - problems: leak elecrtons(recharge!), read is destructive
- sram: transisters only
- locality
    - temporal locality: items accessed recently are likely be accessed again
    - spatial locality: items near those accessed recently are likely to be accessed soon
