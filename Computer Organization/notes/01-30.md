### computer organization

- instructor: alex lam
- course web: course.cse.ust.hk/comp2611
- mid: 26 mar,19:15-21:15
- software: logisim, mars
- grading: homework 3*5, project 15, mid 30, final 40

questions unanswered
- digtital logic
- how to add numbers using electricity

number
- base 2, 10, 16
- size: 2^(k * 10), k m g t p; frequency: 10^(k * 3) *important*

hierarchy: hardware - comp2611 here, focus on ISA - system - application

code: high-level language, assembly language, hardware representation

abstraction
- hierarchical layers
- cope with system complexity
- hidden lower-level details
- interactions using defined interface

ISA: abstract interface between hardware and low-level software
- allows different implementations
- e.g. x86, mips, arm, powerpc

computer, von neumann architecture, *five* parts
- input
- output
- memory(ram, non-volatile)
- processor
    - datapath: process data according to instructions
    - control: command the operations of input, output, memory and datapath

volatile main memory: store programs and data, lose data when lose power;
non-volatile secondary memory: magnetic disk, hard drive, flash storage, optical disk

networks
- local area network: ethernet
- wide area network: the Internet
- wireless network: WiFi, Bluetooth

manufacturing ICs
- silicon ingot -> wafers -> patterned wafers -> tested wafer -> tested dies -> packaged dies -> tested packaged dies
