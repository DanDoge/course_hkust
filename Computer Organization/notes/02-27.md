### data representation

recap
- implicit 1
- biased exponent
- underflow: 2^{k - 1} - 2, 126 and 1022 for single and double respectively
- ISA, diff. hardware run same code

arithmetic operations
- sth. like add res, op1, op2
- each line at most one isntruction
- after # symbol are commons
- simplicity: each instruction has a fixed number of operands
- registers, fixed name, limited numbers
    - 32 registers, 32bits
    - numbered 0 to 31
    - $0, read-only, provide zero
    - registers correspond to variables: $s0, $s1, ..., $s7
    - registers that are temporary: $t0, $t1, ..., $t7

```assembly
add $t0, $s1, $s2
add $t1, $s3, $s4
sub $s0, $t0, $t1
```

smaller -> faster

data transfer
- load data into registers first, processing it, then save them to memory
- do not allow manipulate data in memory directly
- lw, sw, load / save a word

memory addressing
- group memory into bytes
- specify the address of an array, base address + offset
- e.g. 16-bit address -> max memory 2^{16} bytes
- e.g. lw $t0, 32($s0); sw $t0, 48($s0)
