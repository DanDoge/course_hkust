#### pipeline hazard

recap
- ideal pipeline: instructions being independent, balanced pipeline
- control signal in registers passed through stages

dependency
- data hazard
    - if data dependency too close
    - align the earliest time we get the value to the latest time we use it
    - forwarding data / bypassing
    - load and use hazard: one bubble needed
    - code scheduling to avoid stalls: avoid load and use hazard
- control dependency
    - stall on branch: beq -> compare two regs in ID stage, one bubble
    - branch prediction: bet not jumping, if correct, no bubble, else one bubble
- structual hazards
    - competing resources -> duplicate resources
    - write regs in the first half, read in the second half

summary
- increasing instruction throughput
- subject to hazards
- instruction set design affects complexity of pipeline implementation

pipeline datapath with hazard
- reg id being equal -> data hazard
