### instructions

I-type instructions
- op, rs, rt, const/address
- 6, 5, 5, 16

lb: sign extension, lbu: zero extension

precedure
- jump into the precedure and return from it
- necessary steps
    - place the parameters
    - transfer control
    - acquire storage resources
    - perform task
    - place result value
    - return control
- $a0 - $a3: arguments(reg 4 - 7), $v0, $v1: result values(reg 2 - 3), $t0-9: tempraries, can be overwritten by callee, $s0-7: saved, must be saved/restored by callee
- $sp, stack pointer, $ra: return address
- PC / instruction address register: holds address of the current instruction being executed, updated after executing the current instruction
    - PC = PC + 4 or PC = branch target address

procedure call
- jal ProcedureLabel
- two things happen: address of next instruction put in $ra, jumps to ProcedureLabel

return
- jr $ra, jump register

caller and callee
- caller: put parameters in $a0-$a3, invoke jal X
- callee: calculation, place the result in $v0-1, return using jr $ra
- what about nested call?
    - save $ra in stack in the beginning of a function, and load $ra before return
    - stack: LIFO, push, pop, $sp
    - $gp: point to static data
    - $fp: procedure frame
