### multiplication

recap
- carry lookhead
    - use two-level logic -> two cycle overhead
    - carryin_i determined by a, b, and carryin_0
    - C_{i + 1} = G_i + P_{i} C_{i}, generate propergate
    - add a carry look ahead circuit, spend two level gate delay time
- multiplication
    - first algorithm: shift the multiplicand left one bit, shift the multiplier right one bit each time
    - second algorithm: shift the multiplier and product each time, add only on upper half bits, combine the multiplier and product together!
    - signed multiplication: get its abslute value, then multiply them, change the results' sign
    - booth's algorithm: in tutorial
    - hardware speedup: unroll the for loop, use layered adders, 32bit -> 5 levels
    - multiply in MIPS: mult reg, reg, product contained on Hi and Lo, to fetch the interger 32-bit product, mflo / mfhi
        - both instructions ignore overflow
        - no overflow if Hi is 0 for multu; Hi si replicated sign of Lo for mult

division
- paper and pencil example, dividend = quotient * divisor + remainder
    - version1 division hardware: shift right diviser from upper 32bits to lower 32bits, try to subtract from the divident each time, quotient shift left each time
    - version2 division hardware: shift left the divident, and get the quotient by trying to subtract the divisor
        - notice: final correction, the remainder will be shift one bit more, need to shift it back one bit
