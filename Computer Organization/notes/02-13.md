### intro to digital logic

recap
- combination logic: input determine output
- minterm(sop) / maxterm(pos)
- pla

k-map
- graphical representation of truth table
- each entry represente a minterm
- cells arranged following Gray code(e.g. 00 01 11 10)
- simplification rule
    - find largest size(of 2^n) of group of adjacent cells
    - figure out logical expression for each group

sequential logic
- S-R latch: input R, S; output: Q, Q';
    - input R = 1, S = 0, reset Q to 0
    - input S = 1, R = 0, set Q to 1
    - input S = R = 0, latch, perserve current value, say, in mem.
    - input S = R = 1, Q = Q', then go back to (0, 0) to perserve the value, but two possible paths 11->10->00 or 11->01->00, change the value diff.ly, operation not stable
- D-latch: input D(data), WE(write enable)
- register: a collection f D-latches, all controlled by a common WE
- clock: operate simutaneously, rising edge, falling edge, clock period, clock frequency
