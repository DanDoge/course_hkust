### data representation

recap
- assign a number to each bit
- most/least significant bit, 31/0
- 2's complement, using adder to do substract

2's complement for signed integer
- if not overflow, just like convert a decimal number to binary form
- minus number? +x -> +x' -> +x' + 1 -> -x
- range: -2^{k - 1}, 2^{k - 1} - 1
- overflow, underflow
- sign extension / zero extension

floating number
- only store sign, significand and exponent
- approximate arithmetic, for real number has finite range but we get limited precision
- single precition: 1 + 8 + 23, double precision: 1 + 11 + 52
- bias: 2^{k - 1} - 1
