### ALU

goal: 32-bit ALU
- and, or, ass, sub, beq, slt
- connect 32 one-bit ALU together
- one-bit ALU: and, or -> easy
- one-bit adder? input: a, b, carryin, output: sumout, carryout
- all operation executing, but only one selected by the user

how to connect these one-bit ALU?
- share op
- AND and OR operation: independent, just conbine the answers
- ADD: ALUs are dependent
    - SUB: filp all bit, add one => add a MUX to 'b' port, where to add one? let carryin be b_control_signal(called b-invert now)(1 if SUB b, 0 otherwise)
- Ripple carry: wait for precedent ALU for carryin

slt
- find an universial rule: ++, +-, --(complicated, cannot bit-by-bit compare)
- calculate a - b, look at the sign bit, send back to ALU_0('set' signal on ALU_31, send back to 'less' signal on ALU_0)
    - 1 if a < b
    - 0 otherwise
- 'less' signal for ALU_1-31: all zero
- b_invert: set to 1(we need to do subtraction!)

detecting overflow
- we need: operation, signbit of a and b, signbit of result
- output: overflow signal

beq, bne
- reuse existing logical circuit
- subtraction: a - b
- OR all the result
    - output NOR if beq
    - output OR if bne
