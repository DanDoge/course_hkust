### processor

recap
- single-cycle implementation -> pipeline single-cycle implementation
- steps: fetch -> decode -> perform -> memory access -> write back
    - fetch: from PC
    - decode: find what to perform, and read source registers, lw -> one register, other instructions -> two registers
    - perform: execute arithmetic & logical instructions, address calculation for memory-reference instructions, comparison(zero-output in ALU) for conditional branch instructions
    - memory access: lw and sw
    - write back: increment PC or change to target address
- datapath
    - instruction memory: read memory from PC, fetch the instruction from the memory
    - PC: register storing the address
    - adder: increment PC to form the address of the next instruction
    - instruction fetch: PC and 4 -> adder -> PC, PC is an edge-triggered device, worry about branches later
    - control will decide whether to write to the memory
    - multiplexer to select which data should be sent forward

control
- take opcode[31-26], for R-type instruction opcode is all zero, we need another ALU control, Control send a 00 to ALU control for further control, for other type of instructions, 2-bit ALUOp will be sufficient
- control signals
    - read/write: RegWrite, MemWrite, MemRead
    - selsctor input for multiplexers: ALUSrc, MemtoReg, PCSrc, RegDst
    - ALU control inputs
- ALU control: input 6-bit function code, 2-bit ALUOp, output 4-bit ALU Control
- don't care term in K-map can be considerd as a one
