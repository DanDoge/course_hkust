### make up course for 03-18

recap
- dealing with a 32-bit immediate
    - how to load it into a register?
    - I type instrutions cannot hold more than 16bits
    - lui: load upper immediate, then ori, (addi will not work, which use signed extension to the immediate part, addiu also does not work)
    - pseudo instrutions: li -> lui + ori
- addressing
    - immediate / register / base
    - PC relative: offset added to (PC + 4), in number of words(instrutions)
    - pseudo-direct addressing: 26bits offset from the PC(if the initial four bits be the same as the PC, and for the last 2 bits always be zero, only store the mid 26bits) -> out of that? jr

#### arithmetic for computers

operations for unsigned numbers
- sltu, sltiu: u->zero extention
- addu, subu, addiu
    - the immediate value sign extended, only logic operations do zero extension
    - only different from add: no execption when sign overflow
    - subtraction uses addition
- lbu, lhu
    - data transfer instrutions: u->zero extention

detecting overflow
- add: ++ -> -, -- -> +
- sub: +- -> -, -+ -> +
- unsigned overflow? check the 33-th bit

#### arithmetic logic unit

ALU performs
- arithmetic operations
    - one bit full adder
    - one bit ALU
    - ripple carry: chain the 32 ALUs for carryout bit, wait for the ALUs before, easy but slow!
- logical operations
