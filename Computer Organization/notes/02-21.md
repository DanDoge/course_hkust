#### data representation

make-up lecture of the 02-18 lecture... this time cannot be wrong.... i think

recap
- s-r latch: operations set and reset
- d-latch / gated d-latch: import d and not-d, and write enable
- from d-latch to register, d-flip-flop, store one bit of data, write on falling edge
- clock, cycle pattern
- re-generating the value, but not actually rembering this
- store data, min and max number
