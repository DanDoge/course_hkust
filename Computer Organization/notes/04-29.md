### memory system

final: May 29, 12:30pm, Tsang Shiu Tim Art Hall

recap
- move beq to ID stage
- delay for two cycles in the worst case


memory bottleneck: gap between memory performance and cpu performance become bigger

locality in data and instructions

hit or miss
- hit rate, cache hit time, cache miss penalty

issues to cinsider
- block placement
    - block sizes: 32b or 64b
    - direct-mapped: one memory block to one possible cache block
        - calc the block number: block address mod # of blocks in cache
        - calc the block address: mem address / block size
    - set-associative: one memory block to a set of possible cache blocks
    - fully-associative: one memory block to all possible cache blocks
- block identification
- block replacement
- write policy
