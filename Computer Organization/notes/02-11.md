- diff voltage range represents 1 or 1=0, true or false => binary system
- truth table describes behaviour / response
    - gates: NOT, AND, OR, XOR; boolean expr: one output one equation
    - multiplexer / selector, decoder

### logic circuit design

e.g. majority vote of 3 ppl.
- one approach: which configuration leads to output 1?
    - find some magic term: T_1, T_2, ... then OR them!
    - how to find magic term? AND all the inputs ==> minterm(like minimum), m_0, m_1, ...
    - sum-of-products, SOP
- another approach: looking at 0s, magic term: output 0 only for one specific config which leads to output 0
    - then AND them!
    - magic term construction: OR all the NOT of inputs ==> maxterm(maximum of all inputs), M_0, M_1, ...
    - product-of-sums, POS
- gates involved
    - minterm: NOT, AND; then OR gate which combines them
    - maxterm: NOT, OR;then AND gate
- canonical form
- two level logic: building max/minterm; then combine them together
    - input:  a var and its negeted form
    - one level: AND gate only
    - the other level: OR gate only

e.g. PLA(programmable logic array)
- D: at least one of the inputs is one; E: exactly two are one; F: all are one
- construct all the minterm or all the maxterm, count unique terms => num of columns in the first plane
- PLA representation, put a dot if necessary

logical equivalence: output same value for all inputs, two ways to check if equivalent
- truth table
- algebraic manipulation

boolean algebra
- laws: ldentity, null, idempotent(AA in AND form, A + A in OR form), inverse, commutative, associate, absorption, de Morgan's(\bar{AB} in AND form, \bar{A + B} in OR form)
