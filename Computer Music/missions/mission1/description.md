### Source music and modification

The source music is called *Eutopia*, which is kind of a loop of the same melody but modifies it every time. The link to it is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_7ERvudnQ8.

First I reduced the noise in the original music, especially in the last half, And then I added some echo to it to represent the openness of space and make it sound more mysterious. The first 30'' is made up of two 15'' main melody(the latter is gradually pitched down), along with an extended and reversed version of it. After that, an accelerated and reversed version of the main melody represents the bad dreams, even nightmares during the space trip, for a trip for two years always includes some kind of bad dreams, especially for babies. After the bad dream is the strengthened version of the main melody, representing the mother trying to comforting her baby and the arrival of the trip, for the echo is removed this time. The first 15''(or 30'') and the last 20'' can serve as a good lullaby for the two-year space trip.

### The Video

The video tells a slightly different story. I must apologize for not being able to download the movie *Interstellar*, and instead using the Japanese anime *Revue Starlight*(Japanese name: *少女*☆*歌劇 Revue Starlight*) for the video. In the video, a girl, *Daiba nana*(nickname: *banana*), tries to protect her friends from the loop of the tragedy caused by the transfer student *Kagura Hikari*, and chooses to fight *Hikari*. The first half of the video is the everyday life she wishes to protect, while the second half is her fight with *Hikari*. 

The reason I chose this story to the music is that, in a space trip, the mother has to sing her baby to sleep while protecting her baby (e.g. from bad dreams), which is just what *Daiba* does: enjoying her life with her friends while fighting against the loop of the tragedy.
