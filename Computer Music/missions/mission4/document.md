### Source music and modification

The source music is *Re...Japanesque*, which heavily uses the traditional Japanese instrument *Shamisen*.

At the beginning and the end, I added the sound of opening a door and spider's noise. I then separated the different instruments using the FFT filter and changed each channel to fit in the theme. The original music seems a little "thin" for a breakdance, so I strengthened the drum part. The piano part in the beginning sounds a little mysterious, like a spider crawling out of a tomb. The *Shamisen* part in the middle is filtered to sound like a piece of rock music.

The screenshot above shows how I mixed the parts together. The "mia4_diff.wav" file is the "mia4.wav" file without the first("Main") track, where my modification and sound effect can be heard more clearly.
