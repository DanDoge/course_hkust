### Source music and modification

The source music are from the OST of anime *Revue Starlight*, and I added some sound effects to it.

The music consists of two parts, the first(before 30'') being tensive and the second(after 30'') being sad. For the first part, I added storm sound in the background, which may be the symbol of the fierce fight between our hero(ine) and his/her lover for the betrayal. And I gradually let the heartbeat sound fade in to strenthen the feeling of tension. In the last several seconds of the first part, I layered the main molody with itself delayed (by 1&2 bar), like the diagram below:

```
----0----1----2
---------0----1
--------------0
```

It makes the piano part sound out of control. Then the first part is ended by the sound of breaking glass, which may be the symbol of nervous breakdown.

The second part sounds more calmed down, still with raining sound as BGM, but this time being more gentle and slow. I slow it down by 2% twice and mix it with its pitched down version(by 7&12 semitone), and gradually turn up the volume of the turned-down version.

Below is the inferface of AU showing how I mix them together.
