#### Source music and modification

The source musics are *キリンのためのアダージョ*(Adagio for Giraffe, from 1'23'') and *歯車*(gear, from 1'30''). The first part is quite tensive with the frequently repeated drum beat, and the dissonance I added to it indicates the inner struggle these people have been through. The dissonance switches from $\pm5$, $\pm4$ to $\pm2$, so it sounds more and more weird, especially the piano part. Also, cello sound is added from time to time to strengthen the sad feeling. After people looking at each other in silence is the second half. Polytonality is again used, but this time it is $\pm7$, a harmonious interval.

#### Movie and the Story

The movie is *[Mayflower Voyagers](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/xx4gj3)*, which tells the story of English Pilgrims struggled to live in America and then helped by native Indians. The scenes describing their bad living condition on board and struggling for food quite suit the first half of the music. Sound effects(e.g. wind and storm) are added to make this part more vivid.
