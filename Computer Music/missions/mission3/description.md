### Source music and modification

The source music is from the original soundtrack of the anime *Revue Starlight*, and I added some sound effects downloaded from Adobe's website.

So first, I selected three different versions of the same melody from the OST and added walking on snow sound in the gap. The raining sound lasts from the very beginning to the first refrain(around 30'') and then lets the piano dominate the music. Then footstep sound is followed by lightning sound, which breaks the hole music into two halves. And then is the final version of the main melody. The first half is kind of "frozen", for the piano solo and raining and snow sound, and the second half gradually gets warmer and warmer.

This time I did less modification on the sound for more effort was spent to create the story and edit the video. And for this topic is about frozen romance, any special effect(at least anyone I tried) sounds noisy and does not suit this topic. I hope the video and the story behind it will compensate for the simplicity of the music.



### Video

The video tells a love(or friendship?) story between two girls. The black-haired girl lost her memory and could not tell who her lover(or friend) was, so she tries to climb up to catch the star so that her memory can come back. But every time she climbs to the top, she gets knocked down(kind of like *Sisyphus*). And then her lover(or friend) came to rescue her from the endless loop, so they finally are together.

The moving on snow sound suits the scene well, where the heroine walks on the sand. The lightning sound is exactly when she gets knocked down from the tower. And I also tried to align the movie and music each time a new scene was added, for example, the girls run towards each other when the music is in its final refrain, and they lie down and rest when the music sounds calm approaching the end.
