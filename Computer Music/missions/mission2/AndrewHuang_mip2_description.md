### Source music and modification

The source music is [*季曲 ~Seasons of Asia~*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-osPn4-myM), a piece of music from the game *Taiko no Tatsujin*(Chinese name: *太鼓之達人*) by a Taiwan team. The original music itself includes a variety of traditional Chinese instruments and is very suitable for kung fu EDM.

So I selected the final 1 min of the music. And at first, I pitched it up by two semitone step by step and broke the meter by slightly overlapping the repeating parts. Such a non-harmonic interval and a broken meter make the audience feel a sense of urgency. After that is the main melody together with its pitched-up version by 7 semitones, which is a perfect fifth. Then I found its *pipa* version from a [Chinese website](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av7530720) and mixed them together. Near the final, I apply the drunk filter in AU to the music to make it feel more scientific, and at last, I apply the amplifier in AU to make it more like rock music, which I think is a perfect ending for such a kung fu EDM.

### The Video

The video consists of parts in the movie *Kung Fu Panda*.

At first, the panda walks into a restaurant, with the BGM pitched up gradually, which I think will draw people's attention to what will happen next. Then the panda fights the bad people(animals) and beats them when the main melody comes in. After that, I selected the part where Shifu fights the Furious Five, for the action scene there is more fluent and suitable for the *pipa*, and Shifu takes the *Dizi* in hand, which is another traditional Chinese instrument. Then is the scene where the panda is selected to be the Dragon Warrior, which marks the end of the video.
