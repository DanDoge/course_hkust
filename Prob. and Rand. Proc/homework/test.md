One of my strong points is that I am a very organised person. One example of this might be my room, which is very neat and organised with everything having its own dedicated space. Another example is my computer, in which all files are organised in specific folders divided in categories.
Another strong point of mine is that I am a very curious person by nature, meaning that whatever you put in my way I will be willing to do hours of research on, until I feel like I have a good understanding of the subject.

A weaker point of mine is that I tend to be a little dominant, meaning that I have the tendency to enforce my opinions and ideas on people, wanting them to adopt them completely. I am working on this.
Another weak point is that I tend to overwork myself by not quitting working until I fall down from exhaustion or stress.

I want to be able to work with large groups of people on one project, using version control by means of Git.

I want to be able to working with Git (in this case Gitlab) flawlessly and efficiently.

This is important to me because I know that for the most part in the ICT world you will be working on projects in larger groups of people, so being able to work with version control will help me integrate into the group without any trouble.

I will have succeeded once I am able to do whatever is required in Git, no matter what, without any trouble.

I am currently actively working on these goals by means of working on this project.

The communication in this group has been going really well and is working together really nicely. Git started our pretty nicely but far from smoothly. It still requires some work to get everybody to work with it.

Following the lectures and attending every meeting will definitely help achieving my goals, though I feel like attending the meetings is the one most useful.

Nothing is stopping me from reaching my goals.

I will do a lot of research and study the required knowledge to make sure I have a perfect understanding of what I am doing. As of today I am starting this research.

Right now what I am going to do is read into the usefulness of branches and look into the possibility of utilising it to seperate the jobs for every individual.

My teammates can help me by doing research of their own and discussing their findings with me and the others, so everybody can get a full understanding of the subject and workflow.

My action plan:

- Take a relevant subject, for instance the branching
- Research what it is and how to properly utilise it
- Try utilising it and practice until completely comfortable
- Repeat
