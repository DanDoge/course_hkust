### central limit theorem

sum of X_i: mean being nm, var being n sigma^2
- define Z_n = S_n - nm / sigma sqrt(n)
- lim P[Z_n < z] = N(0, 1)

estimation sample size to make sure error less than 5%
- Chebyshev inequality: 100% sure error rate less than 5%, result in large numbers
- central limit theorem: not absolute guarantee, but results in a manageable number of samples

### random processes

discrete-time: time ixdex is a countable set

continuous-time: time being continuous

events and equivalent events
- events specified by time

joint distributions of time samples
- first order distribution: F_{X(t)}(x) = P[X(t, epsilon) < x]
- first order density: f_{X(t)}(x) = d/dx F_{x}(x, t)
- second order distribution: F(x_1, x_2) = P[X(t_1) < x_1 and X(t_2) < x_2]

iid process
- Bernoulli random process

sum random process
