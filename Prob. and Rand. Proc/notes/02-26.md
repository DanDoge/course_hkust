### random variable

random variable as a function assigns a number to each outcome of an experiment
- domain fo the random variable
- range of the random variable

e.g. three toss of a fair coin
- X be the number of heads of three coin, X(e) = 0, 1, 2, 3
- Y be the reward to the player, Y(e) = 0, 1, 8

randomness determined by the experiment
- the probability of an event B is the probability of the equivalent event: A = {e | X(e) \in B}

discrete random variable
- values from a countable set, finite if the set is finite
- random variable from an experiment with a finite countable of outcomes must be discrete

we wish...
- compute probability of events directly without going back to equivalent events
- compute probability in various ways
    - probability mass function
        - only for discrete variables
        - a.e. = 0
        - properties
            - p(x) >= 0
            - sum of all p(x) = 1, for the sets A_x = {e | x(e) = x} are a partition of the sample space
            - p(x \in B) = sum of all x in B p(x)
    - cumulative distribution function
    - characteristic function

e.g. Bernoulli random variable
- indicator function of set A, I_A(e) = 1[e in A]

e.g. Binomial random variable
- p(k) = p(x = k) = C_{k}^{n}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}

expectation of a random variable
- sum of xp(x)
- if |x|p(x) converges absolutely, if not, the expected value does not exist
- relative frequency interpretation
    - average of X in a large number of observations of X
    - which is sum of xf(x), when n goes to inf, it becomes sum of xp(x)
    - best guess: to minimize sum of (x - c)^2
