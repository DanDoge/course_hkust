### continuous random variables

single RV
- discrete, continuous, mixed
- cumulative distribution function
- probability density function
- probability mass function does not apply to continuous RV

cumulative distribution function
- F(x) = P(X <= x)
- unit step function: u(x) = 1 if x >= 0
    - f(x)u(x)
    - a \* u(x - x_0)
    - then F(x) = sum of p(x_0)u(x - x_0)
- properties
    - 0 <= F(x) <= 1
    - F(inf) = 1, F(-inf) = 0
    - F(X) is non-decreasing
    - continous from the right
- using F(x^{-}) to repersent P(X < x)
- discrete RV's CDF is constant except for jumps at a coutable set of points
- continuous RV's CDF is continous everywhere
- mixed type's CDF has discrete jumps, but is not constant between jumps

probability density function
- the derivative of the CDF
- NOT the probability the X = x, but is proportional to the probability that X is close to x
- properties
    - f(x) >= 0
    - F(X) = sum of f(x), x <= X
    - sum of f(x) = 1
    - P(a < X <= b) = sum a to b f(x)

e.g. expononential RV
- F(x) = (1 - e^{-ax})u(x)
- f(x) = ae^{-ax}u(x)

pdf of discrete RV
- F(x) = sum of p(x_k)u(x - x_k)
- f(x) = sum of p(x_k)\delta(x - x_k)

expectation for continuous RV
- E[X] = sum of xf(x) dx
