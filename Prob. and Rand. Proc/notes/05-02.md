### random process

sum random process
- like a random walk
- independent and stationary increment processes
    - non-overlapping increments are independent and stationary
    - stationary: distribution of increment with the same length does not change with time
    - P[S_m = j, S_n = k] = P[S_m = j] * P[S_{n - m} = k - j]
    - poisson process
        - N_m(t) = sum of X_i from 1 to floor(mt)
        - X_i is a Bernoulli random process with parameter p
        - P(N_m(t) = k) = C_{k}^{floor(mt)} p^k (1 - p)^{floor(mt) - k} -> (lambda t)^k / k! e^{-lambda t}
        - P(N(y) = k) = (lambda t)^k / k! e^{-lambda t}
        - number of events occurred up to time t, where events occur at random isntants in time at an average rate of lambda per unit time
        - time interval between adjacent events is exponentially distributed with parameter lambda
        - suppose exactly one event occurs in [0, t], the time the event occurs is uniformly distributed on [0, t]
        - second order density
            - P[N(t_1) = k, N(t_2) = n] = n! / k!(n - k)! p^k (1 - p)^{n - k} * poisson part
