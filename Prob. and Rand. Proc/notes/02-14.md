### counting method

computing probability by counting element events, if all the outcome are equiprobable, then
- P(A) = num of outcomes in A / total number of outcomes in sample space
- then P(A) is a measure of the size of set A

counting methods
- number of ordered k-tuples: n_1 * n_2 * ... * n_k
- sampling(replacement, and ordering): n^k, n! / (n - k)!, n! / (n - k)!k!, notice: outcomes should not be assumed equally probable
- permutation: n!, stirling formula
