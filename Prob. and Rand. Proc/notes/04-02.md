### pairs of random variables

approximations by product form events
- e.g. circle approximated by rectangles?

joint density functions
- f(x, y) = d^2 F(x, y) / dxdy
- non-negative
- F(x, y) = integral of f(x, y)
- e.g. uniform distribution

### conditional probability

for continuous x and y
- define F_{Y|X} = P[Y <= y and x <= X <= x + h] / P[x <= X <= x + h], otherwise P[X = x] is zero
