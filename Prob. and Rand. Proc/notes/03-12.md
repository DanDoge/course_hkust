### expectation of continuous RV

expectation of continuous random variable
- E[x] = \sum xf(x) dx
- E[g(x)] = \sum g(x)f(x) dx
- linearity of the expectation
    - E[\sum a_i g_i(x)] = \sum a_i E[g_i(x)]

variance of continuous of RV
- Var[X] = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2
- varience of the Gaussian
    - 1/sqrt(2\pi)\sigma exp(-(x - \miu)^2 / 2\sigma^2)
    - pdf intergrates to 1, multiplying by \simga and differentiating w.r.t \sigma

moments
- n-th moment, n-th central moment

minimum mean squared error estimation
- MSE(c) = E[(x - c)^2]
- d MSE(c) / dc = 0 --> c = E[X]

- uniform RV
- exponential RV: aexp(-ax)
    - a can be interperted as the rate at which events occur
    - memoryless property
    - relation with geometric RV
        - devide one time unit into n subitnervals, s.t. at most oen event occur per subitnerval with probability a / n
        - P_e[X > t] = P_g[M > nt] = (1 - a / n)^{nt} -> exp(-at)
- Gaussian
    - normalized: 1 / sqrt(2\pi) exp(-x^2 / 2), and let t = x - m / sigma
    - Q(x) = 1 - \Phi(x) = \Phi(-x)
