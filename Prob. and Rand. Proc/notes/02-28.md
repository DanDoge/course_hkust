#### mean and varience

e.g. find the E[X] of the binomial RV with parameter n and p
- E[x] = sum of xp(x)
    - long term average of X if experimetn repeat many times
    - center of the probability mess function
    - "best" gurss of the random variable, argmin_{c} E[(x - c)^{2}]
- e[x] = np, form definition, make change of variables

expected value ofthe function of a RV
- E[Z] = sum of zp(z), p(z) = sum of p(x), where f(x) = z
- E[Z] = sum of f(x)p(x)
    - rearrange the sum to group all terms x that maps to the same value z
- useful results
    - E[aX] = aE[X]
    - E[C] = C
    - E[aX + bY + c] = aE[X] + bE[Y] + c, linearity of expectation

e.g. packet voice transmission
- 48 people can be speaking with probability of 1 / 3, while the capacity of system being 20
- let z be the number of packets discarded
- z = max{0, x - 20}, where x being # of people speaking

varience
- measures how much the values of the random variable differ from the mean
- define D being difference between the value of random variable and its mean, D = X - EX
- define VAR of a RV being VAR[X] = E[D^{2}] = E[(X - EX)^{2}]
- VAR[X + c] = VAR[X]
- VAR[cX] = c^{2}VAR[X]

bias-varience decomposition
- mean square of the guess = E[(X - c)^{2}] = E[(X - EX + EX - c)^{2}] = VAR[X] + (EX - c)^{2}
- the latter is the bias, while the former being the varience
- given the intuitive that the expectation being the best guess, but the expectation still could be wrong for the varience

moments
- the n-th moment is E[X^{n}]
- the n-th central moment is E[(X - EX)^{n}]
- important moments
     - first moment, the mean
     - second central moment, the varience
