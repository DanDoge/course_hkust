### function of a RV

y = g(x)
- x is discrete, then y must be discrete
- x is continuous, y may be discrete / continuous / mixed type
    - special case: g(x) = x^{2} => derive from cdf, more complicated in cubic case
    - for one-to-one mapping: f(y) = f_{X}(g^{-1}(y)) / (dy/dx)
    - Y = X^{2}, X ~ N(0, 1), Y: chi-squared RV, with one degree of freedom
