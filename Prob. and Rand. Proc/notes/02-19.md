#### conditional probability

the most important part of this course. decision based cond. prob.: RL course

e.g. pizza

conditional probability definition: P(A | B) = P(A \cap B) / P(B)
- P(A): priori probability
- P(A | B): posteriori probability
- question: P(A | B) ? P(A)
- relative frequency interpretation: n(a and b) / n(b)
- restricting the sample space

properties
- if b in a, p(a | b) = 1
- if a in b, then p(a | b) >= p(a)
- p(a | b) is probability measure

use conditional probability
- simplify computation
    - P(a and b) = P(b | a)P(a), product rule
    - verify your answer in exam
    - total probability, P(a) = \sum P(a | b)P(b)
- bayes rule
    - p(b | a) = p(ab) / p(a) = p(a | b)p(b) / \sum p(a | b)p(b)

independence
- p(ab) = p(a)p(b)
- p(a | b) = p(a), p(b | a) = p(b)
- event a b c d ... are independent iff any group of k of them are independent for all k less than n

specificity? false positive / negative
- from wikipedia
    - sensitivity: true positive rate
    - specificity: true negative rate
