grading
- homework 10%
- mid term: 26/05 13:30-14:50, 35%
- final 55%

objective
- understand prob. models in *engineering*
- develop prob. models

modelling: an approximate representation of a physical situation
- good models: simple and understandable, predictable
- math model <-> computer simulation model
    - math: assumptions in the form of math relations, the simpler the easier but less predictivity?
    - comp: assumptions as a program, more detail, more accurate but cannot analyze precisely
- deterministic model <-> probabilistic model
    - former: determine the exact outcome, if random deviations are small, then ok
    - latter: determine the prob. of different outcomes; can design complex systems; offline designed and optimized -> save money and time

relative frequency
- e.g. picking balls from urn. term.: trials, outcome, elementary events, random experiment: outcome cannot be exactly determined
- def: relative freq = $f_{k}(n) = \frac{N_{k}(n)}{n}$
- statistical regularity: as n inc, relative freq. converges to $p_k$, s.t. lim f(n) = p
- properties
    - falls in [0, 1]
    - sums to 1
    - mutually exclusive events f(a or b) = f(a) + f(b)

reconmmender systems
- collaboeative filtering: group users by their preferences, recommend things liked by users of the same group
- content-based filtering: group contents, recommend items in the same group

**prob. to make better decisions**
