### building a probability model

random experiments
- definition: stating an experimental procedure, and measurements
- sample spaces: set of all possible outcomes
    - outcome: cannot be decoposed into other results
    - discrete sample space: countable
    - continuous sample space: not countable
- event: subset of the sample space
    - event A occurs when the outcome is in A
    - certain event, null event, elementary event

set theory
- set operations: union, intersection, complement, mutual exclusion
- properties: commutative, associative, distributive, deMorgan

axioms of probability
- probability law: a rule that assign to each event A a number P(A) that satisfies
    - P(A) is non-negative
    - P(S) is 1
    - if A and B are mutually exclusive, P(A + B) = P(A) + P(B); general form => infinite version
- corollary
    - P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)
    - P(A) <= 1
    - P(\phi) = 0
    - P(\sum_{1}^{n} A_{k}) = \sum_{1}^{n} P(A_{k})
    - P(A + B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
    - if A < B, then P(A) < P(B)

probability laws for assigning probability
- assign probability to some sub-class of events which gives enough information to determine the probability of any events
- for finite discrete sample space
    - probability of the elementary events. e.g. for a roll die, assign {1}, {2}, ..., {6}; equiprobable outcomes => "chosen at random"
    - continuous sample spaces. cannot assign probability to individual events. if S = [a, b], A = [c, d], then P{A} = \frac{d - c}{b - a}, then P({x_0}) = P([x_0, x_0]) = 0
