### conditional probability

p(x | C) = 0, if x not in C
         = p(x) / p(C) if x in C

total probability theorem
- p(x) = sum of p(x | b_{i}) p(b_{i})
- E[X] = sum of E[X | B_{i}] P(B_{i})
    - for that p(x) = sum of p(x | B_{i}) p(B_{i})
- Var[X] = E[X^{2}] - (E[X])^{2}
         = sum of E[X^{2} | B_{i}] P(B_{i}) - (sum of p(x | B_{i}) p(B_{i}))^{2}

conditional cdf and pdf
- F(x | C) = P(X <= x and X in C) / P(C)
- f(x | C) = d/dx F(x | C)
