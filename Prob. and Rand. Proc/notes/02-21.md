### sequential experiments

devide experiment into a sequence of sub experiments
- identical / non-identical
- dependent / independent
- if experiments are identical, then individual sample space are identical, but not vice versa
    - e.g. number of students sleeping in class
    - not independent
    - individual sample space is identical
    - sub-experiment not identical
- Cartesian product to denote the sample space

assuming
- sub-experiments are independent
- then P(a b c) = p(a) p(b) p(c)

sequential experiments
- bernoulli trials
    - two possible outcomes
    - binary sample space
    - binomial probability law: p_n(k) = (n, k)p^k(1 - p)^{n - k}
- multinominal probability law
    - p(a, b, c, d) = n! / a! b! c! d! p^{a} ... p^{d}
    - not tested
- geometric probability law
    - infinite number of bernoulli trials
    - the number of trials until success(including the success trial)
    - the number of trials before success, also called teh geometric probability law
    - sum to one
- sequence of dependent experiments
    - markov chain
    - trellis coded modulation
