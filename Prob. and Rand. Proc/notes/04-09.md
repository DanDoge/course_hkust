### expectation of function of two variables

E[g(x, y)] = sum of all g(x, y)p(x, y)

COV(X, Y) = E[(X - EX)(Y - EY)] = E[XY] - EX * EY

X and Y are uncorrelated if COV[X, Y] = 0

correlation coefficient
- rou_{x, y} = COV[X, Y] / sigma_x sigma_y
- correlation coefficient leq 1

conditional expectation
- E[Y | x] = sum of yp(y | x)
- E[E[Y | X]] = E[Y]
