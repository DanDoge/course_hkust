### Gaussian Random Variables

assume X_1, ..., X_n are jointly Gaussian
- any subset of X_1, X_n is also jointly Gaussian
- if X_1, ..., X_n are uncorrelated, they are also independent
- conditional density of any subset conditioned on any other subset is also Gaussian
- any affine transformation of a Gaussian vector is also Gaussian

### law of large numbers

sums of random Variables
- E[sum of X_i] = sum of E[X_i]
- VAR[sum of X_i] = sum of VAR[X_i] + sum of sum of COV[X_i, X_j]

 sample mean
 - M_n = 1/n sum of X_i
 - unbiased: E[M_n] = m
 - VAR[M_n] = sigma^2 / n

useful inequalities
- markov inequality
    - suppose X is non-negative, P[X >= a] <= E[X] / a
- chebyshev inequality
    - P[|X - m| >= a] <= (sigma/a)^2

law of large numbers
- weak law of large numbers
    - lim P[|M_n - m| < epsilon] = 1
    - proof: P[|M_n - m| < epsilon] > 1 - sigma^2 / (n epsilon^2)
- strong law of large numbers
    - P[lim M_n = m] = 1
- application: relative freqency will approach real probability
