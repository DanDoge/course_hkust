### the opening of Japan, 1853-58

difference betweem Bakufu/Shogunate(幕府) and Shogun(将军)
- like president and presidency
- the Shogun as an individuial, while Bakufu as an institution

Problem: Shogunate govern the whole Japan but collect tax from its own region
- conflict between the interest of Japan and Shogun
- strengthen the civil defence against foreigners
- Daimyo talks the interest of Japan while Shogun cares his teritory(collect money from other Daimyo)
    - really use money for infrastrucure? or for Shogun's purpose
    - open Shogun's accounting book to Daimyos? -> change towards modern politic

decicated power from Emperor
- not bear responsibility of bad government
- but also means the Emperor can *take away* the power
- Emperor not responsible to all mis-governing, always right
- suspect of "secret politics" of the Bakufu

spread of Nativist learning in Japan
- 大和魂
- 国体, national body
- all Japanese as the descendent of the Emperor, and the Emperor as the descendent of the Sun godness

policy making
- the information and knowledge from oversea, is it well-shared to common people?
- policy making by Bakufu officials? with Daimyos? with ordinary people?

reaction to foreign ships
- humanitarian help
- while military prepare
- trade with foreign country
- fire/warning to foreign ship(the teritory/sovereign concept)
    - different from China's response

coming of commodore Perry
- want supply coal in Japan, but rejected many times
- so he prepared militarily(not authorised), while Japanese waiting for his coming
- documents: English -> Dutch -> Japanese
- cannnot fight with Perry
    - technology
    - sea transportation is important, while Japan has no navy(like China in the Opium war)

reform right after Perry leave
- military towards western style
- opening policy: open, open to learn tech from western, not open, diverse views in Daimyos
    - use Emperor?
