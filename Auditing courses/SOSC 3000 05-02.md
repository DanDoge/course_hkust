### symbolic interaction and dramaturgical approach

symbolic interaction
- humans are different from animals for the ability to create symbols
- meanings are not fixed, but emerged through social interactions
- meanings are dynamic, humans can have a choice to interpret and response to it differently
- quantitative methodology cannot capture the complexity and the dynamic of meanings
- meaning cannot be quantified and fit into the equation and model, need for a qualitative methodology: in-depth ethnographic fieldwork, participant observation
- *Outsiders*: against the statistical and medical definition of deviance for it is not objectively given but subjectively problematic
- in-depth interview on the dancing musicians and their use of marijuana
    - not stupid, not insane
    - process of using marijuna
        - the beginner: in a small group setting, need small group subculture to overcome socieial controls and stigma, need social network
        - learn the technique and ritual: learn the technique from friends, interpret the effect(selectively dismiss the unpleasant effects and reinterpret it as pleasure and enjoyable), only when you define the effect as pleasure the action continues
        - occasional user to frequent user: the problem of supply / secrecy(connections to the dealer, hide the secret, "pass" as a normal person)
        - the technique of rationalization: nertralize the negative label assigned by the dominant society(marijuana just a minor vice, invigorate your spirit, does not consider oneself as a slave to the drug)
    - deviant is subjectively problematic
    - deviance is a process, people can enter / leave at different stages *everyone is a potential deviant*
    - focus on **control agencies** that manufactured deviance, once official label put on one, one will have a deviant career for life, people interact with one with a deviant label(that is why prosoners always come back to prison)

dramaturgical approach
- front stage
    - the setting: physical scene that ordinarily must be there if the actors are to perform
    - the personal front: items tell the performer's social status
    - manner: the role the performer expects to play in the situation
- idealization: society has certain role-expectation expect people to perform
    - playing down: intelligent girl has to play dumb to fit the gender sterotype
    - playing up: housewife cleans home before bringing guests home
- phony performance: what if actor forgets lines? be creative, keep on performing, hoping audience won't notice
    - e.g. students in exam: the more one write, the more possible one do not know the answer
- team try to conceal the errors, team talk to sustain another's performance
- back stage    
    - relax when no need to act anymore, can eb totally different from front stage
