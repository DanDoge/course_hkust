### the tension between politiclal system and socio-economy

welfare: moral duty of rulers
- traditional high hierachial system
- still used by Chinese today
- but Shogun do not interfere in local daimyo's welfare, but deal with conflict between daimyos
- political decentralization

changes in society
- decline of Osaka as a merchant center
- gap between of poor and rich
- village as tex unit, but within village rich and poor
    - land legally not allowed to sell, but not practically
    - labors leave village
- market of rice / food; 畿内, richest region, while Touhoku volnerable to climate change
    - merchant make profit out of food market, but people suffer
    - low rice price: good for urban people, but not for samurais(paid in rice) -> structure problem
    - international trade may be a good solution

three major reform by the Shoguante
- which daimyo to contact to the foreigners?
- tax from the merchants -> first organize a merchant guilds -> regulate markets
- attack rice merchants: not in person, just get their rice out; store rice? seems unnecessary in peace time
- emperor as signal of help
- 大盐平八郎: rebel for rice, back to time when emperor in power
    - called *ikki*, not actually rebellion, rightful petitions
