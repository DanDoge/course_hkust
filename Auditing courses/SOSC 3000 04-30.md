### Weberian: the rise of east Asia

Weber's research and finding
- question: why capitalism emerged in West Europe
- finding: Protestant ethic led to the spirit of capitalism
- but Weber didnot talk about E. Asia

the rise of E. Asia
- backwardness before 1950s
- 1960, Japan; 1970, four little dragons; 1980, four little tigers; 1990, China
- E. Asia emerged as the center of capital accumulation of global economy
- Weberian look for a new ethos in E. Asia capitalism
    - what do E. Asia countries share in common? Confucianism
    - turn Weber upside down, Weber: Confucianism as the barrier to capitalism
    - *Emigrant Enterpreneurs: Shanghai Industrialists in Hong Kong*
        - Confucianism trapped by imperial state in the past, but release its potential now
        - overseas Chinese in SE. Asia, Chinese emigrants controlled local business
        - Chinese in HK, compete the British corporations even in the colonial era
        - mainland China since 1970s
    - new ethos of capitalism in E. Asia
        - education: Chinese parents invest in education more; states invest in education; education becomes an end in itself
        - family: a strong dose of familism in society; large percentage of small family enterprises in E. Asia; the value of your own boss; borrow from relatives to set up the firm; children as cheap labor; fits the fluctuations of world market
        - personal management: extend relationship to non-kin workers; flexibility in working hours; dilute class conflict / consciousness / solidarity
- bureaucratic authoritarian as a new factor of **developmental state** in E. Asia
    - strong capacity to formulate strategic industrial policy
    - *Embedded Autonomy: States and Industrial Transformation*
        - normative commitment to development: economic development put at the highest priority, even as the expense of other goals
        - state run like a Weberian bureaucratic: recruitment and promotion based on technical competence and meritocracy; attract the most talented graduates; rigorous standard of recruitment generates a sense of unity / common identity among bureaucratic elites; historical legacy of Confucianism provide the bureaucrats with legitimacy to rule in E. Asia
        - develop long-term industrial policy to promote the market: state to take the initiative to identity winners and encourage the firms to invest in it
        - impose discipline on the market with carrots and sticks
        - bureaucratic autonomy and good state-business relationship: from historical legacy, state being highly autonomous from the society; state control over all credits
    - embedded autonomy to indicate the feature of high bureaucratic autonomy wiht good business relationship
