3 types of authority
- Charismatic authority(which is the third... I forgot to take notes before...)
    - legitimated by the extraordinary leader
    - followers believe the leader has devine power
    - distupts the normal routine in everyday life, tears people from boredom
    - Donald Trump: MAGA
    - Xi Jinping: China dream
    - highly revolutionary: followers totally committed to serve the leader, appeals to emotion, not rationality. Mao: go to countryside to learn from peasents and workers
    - cannot las long, leads to the problem of succession when the leader gets old/died; need to be anchored by rules and regulation: the routinization of charisma

bureaucracy
- way of coordinating peoples
- technical superiority of bureaucracy over other form of organization
- only emerged in modern industrial capitalism, fits in the ethos of capitalism
- characteristics -> ideal type used for compare research
    - goal oriented
    - hierarchy of authority: embedded in the office not the person
    - detailed rules and regulations
    - elaborate division of labor
    - personnel decisions: personnels recruited, per/demoted based on technical competence, procedure written down in black and write
    - impersonality: personnal characteristics disappear
    - leveling of social differences: bureaucracy as a equalizer for it only discriminate people according to their technical competence
- problems
    - hard to destory
    - famous for percise obedience
    - cannot be replaced easily: chaos if absent
    - trained in-capacity: cannot handle new situations
- universial trend of bureaucratization
    - growing size of organization in the economy spread to the state
    - the future organization is bureaucracy, no way out! Marxist socialist being a nightmare of bureaucracy, not a solution to it
    - bureaucracy has a life of its own, indestructable
