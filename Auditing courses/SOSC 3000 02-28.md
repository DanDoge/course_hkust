### state and the class

rise of neo-marxist
- Vietnam war, anti-war movements
- post-war new generation coming to age
- end of long-period of postwar economic prosperity
    - re-discovery of poverty, innequality
- illusion of affluent society, social equality, democracy
- equally critical to capitalism and USSR

foundation of democratic state: pluralism
- right to form political group
- no one group donimate other groups
- dispersion of pover, group check and balance with another
- state being neutral, transparent, responsive to voters' demands

neo-marxists' response
- state being the instrument of the capitalist class
- capitalists connected: socially, economically, politically
- manipulate the working class: lack of information, voting as a personality game, voter apathy
- Solution: more mobilization at elections

counter-argument against the outdatedness of Marxism
- dispersion of ownership and decomposition of capital
    - no dispersion of ownership, monopoly capital through mergers
    - no decomposition of capital, but owner-directors
    - managers are capitalist, profit-oriented, own shares
    - offering shares to by loyalty
- decomposition of workers into skilled, etc.
    - only the working poor, no affluent workers
    - feminization of poverty
    - urban underclass of immigrants, minorities
    - income fall, growing number of homeless, bankcruptcy in inner cities
- expansion of educated professional middle class
    - only prolerarianization and degration of work for white collar and service workers
    - devalueation of education degrees
    - professionals as flexible workers or procarious workers
    - job security, income, control of work disapperearing
- emergence of welfare state
    - repleaced lean and mean government
    - cut the social services, offer them at the market rate
    - go after you for taxes, fees, but charge you at market rate for services
- institutionalization of class conflict through collective bargaining
    - no decreasing class conflict, but deflected to other new form of social movement
    - no decreasing class violence, but deflected to random violence, racial violence agianst the minorities
