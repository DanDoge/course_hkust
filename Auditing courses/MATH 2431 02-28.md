### honor probability

game: roll die, aim to min E(Y - e)^2, where Y is the result of die rolling, and e is the guess
- which is the best guess? 3.5 from intuition
- E(Y - e)^2 = E(Y - EY + EY - e)^2 = E(Y - EY)^2 + (EY - e)^2
    - so e = EY is the best guess
- given the result is even / odd(denoted by X), which is the best guess now?
    - E(Y | X = odd), conditional expection given a event
- what if we do not know which value X is?
    - conditional expectation given a random variable, which will be availble in the future
    - E(Y | X) = 4 or 3, depends on which X is
- naive example
    - E(Y | Y) = Y
    - E(Y | X), say the X is the weather of tomorrow, E(Y | X) = EY, a constant function
- law of total expectation
    - E(E(Y | X)) = EY
    - devide into small classes and sum them together
