### social theory and modernity

critical school, about marxists' response to the critics

cold war, capitalism and communism
- communism forbidden in west countries, "write terror"
- marxist re-introduced in 1960s
    - vietnam war, feminist, black people
    - critical school(by german interllectuals running form nazi) and new left(diff. from old left, USSR and PRC)
    - economic prosperity post-war, affluent workers
    - new left criticise USSR for only focus on economy, "economism", and no freedom
    - call for a return to the humanism of young marx, worker as a human than an agent / tool

basic arguments of critical school
- science, "scientism"
    - study objects, and use this method to measure human beings into numbers and equations
    - focus on appearence -> superficial, while neglect the essence, cannot summarize human into figures
    - high bias, thus do not believe in facts
        - e.g. hk people agree prc's package according to hk survey center? opinion poll are funded (*by whom*), biased(*to whom*) -> conservative bias
- culture
    - technical / informational rationality(choose the best mean to th end), everywhere in capitalism
    - focus on means lead to forgetting the goal
    - maxmize the profit, but irrational(increasing misery, inequality, suffering in capitalist society)
    - introdution of culture industry and mass media: deception(alienation), manipulation of consumer behaviour and creation of false needs(manipulating gender roles, woman as sexy object, man as masculine image)
    - leads to...
        - unconscious indoctrination, taken sth. for granted, e.g. the need to buy / watch / ..., -> loss of freedom and autonomy
        - one-dimentional men & totalitarianism, total control and no escape on men
    - solution: critical theory to expose irrationality, emancipation to librate youself from the constraint in capitalism

decline of the critical school
- left cultual study: movie, book, mass media
- scientific community fight back
    - where is the hard evidence? no research back it up
- changing historical context
    - return of economy / political problem
- solution not useful, change the individual, not the macro structure
