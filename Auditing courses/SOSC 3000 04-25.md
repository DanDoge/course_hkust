- pre-destination: fate pre-determined, but sign of one being chosen by god is in doubt
- salvation anxiety: how can one know th esign of salvation
- this-worldly asceticism, a calling from God to be able to accmulate money

- only apply to the first generation, kas a life of its own

     - reincarnation in India, this-world being not important
