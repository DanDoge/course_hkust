### intro

interruption
- cpu device driver initiates io
- io controller initiates io
- input ready / output conplete / error, generates interrupt signal
- cpu receiving interrupt, transfer control to interrupt handler
- interrupt handler processes data, returns
- cpu resumes processing of previous work

storage hierarchy
- fast, small in capacity, costly: higher
- primary storage: only kind of storage directly accessed by cpu, volatile, random access, DRAM
- main mem: only storage that is large and availble to cpu
- secondary storage
    - nvm, speed comparable to main mem, not lose data, but costly; e.g. flash mem
    - ssd: faster, smaller, costly
    - hard-disk: slow; disk->circle-> track->sector; files seperated into blocks forming a linked list, find the first block, then second, then ...; sequential access: fast, but random: low
    - caching: any level of the storage hierarchy, upper level can be cache lower level; data access should follow constraints(small proportion accessed most of the time); first check if in cache, if not, , go down the storage hierarchy, copy to cache; cache policy, what should be cached, data popularity changes over time, predict future based on historical data; avg. access time is weighted sum of hit time and miss time, the former is orders of magnitude smaller, so decrease miss rate! => locality, temporal and spatial, lru

io subsystem
- os: hide hardware from users
- responsible for
    - mem management: buffering, caching, spooling(overlapping output of job a and input of job b, io pipeline, decrease io latency)
    - general device-driver interface, plug and play
    - driver for specific hardware devices
- dma: for high speed io devices, e.g. network interface; directly transmit data from buffer to main mem w/o cpu; rdma(remote ~): to main mem of a remote computer through the network, e.g. in gpu clusters; but not necessary for slow speed devices, say keyboard mouse

multiprocessor sys.
- adv.: nearly linearly increased throughput, scalibility(server farm made up), increased reliablity
- types: asymmetric(each processor assigned to specific tasks, numa), symmetric(each processor performs all tasks, share the same memory, get same data latency)
- numa: each cpu holds its own mem., fast when access its own mem. but slow when other cpu's mem.; asymmetric, each cpu has its own locality; popular in high end servers, how to schedule these processors

operating system: definitions depends on the point of view
- from a user's view: convenience, good performance; not resource utilization
- shared computer(e.g. mainframe): all users happy(file sharing, not starving), utilize resourse, os controls the usage of hardware
- mobile devices: constraints -> optimized for usability and battery life, specific ui: voice, touch screen
- no user interface(e.g. embedding comp. or automobiles, watches): run without intervention
- conclusion: no universally accepted definition
    but can be devided into 3 components
    - kernel(runs all times on the computer, controls hardwares, not have to contact with users)
    then everything else...
    - system program(ships with the os, but not part of the kernel, interact with the kernel) / application program(apps, word processor, etc., directly interact with users)
    - middleware(frameworks provide services to app. developers, databases, multimedia, graphics, etc)

history
- early days: expensive computers / mainframes, input program on tapes in machine lang.; focus on hardware utilization; one app at a time / batch systems(a queue of jobs keeping cpu busy), os as runtime library, load the next job while the current one runs
- these days: human time more valuable, interactive computing real time, time-sharing: run muitlple programs at the same time(multiprogramming); jobs, active or inactive; switch jobs frequently, but still one job one time(multitasking / timesharing); process, cpu scheduling(which job / process to run), swapping processes on and out mem., virtual mem.

computing environments
- traditional
    - stand-alone general purpose machines
    - portal provide web access to interal sys.
    - net work computers / clients, like web terminals
    - mobile computers, interconnect via wireless networks
    - networking essential
- mobile
    - resource constraints
    - new apps. augmented reality: quickly interact with environments, not necessary to compute on this device, can connect with remote servers
- client-server
    - lab: CSE user name / pwd.
    - file-server system
- peer-to-peer
    - no central server, all computers are servers and clients
    - node join p2p network
    - e.g. torrent file: broadcast a request / respond to a request
- cluster systems
    - parallel computing, distribute tasks to diff. clients which contact with the storage network
- real-time embedded sys.
    - tight time constraints
    - e.g. sensor sys., automobiles, areocrafts

virtualization
- allows os run as an app on the host os
- a virtualization layer on top of hardwares, then diff. os on this layer, each os believes it is the only os on these hardware without knowing the virtualization layer
- reason: one os cannot fully utilize hardware resources; enables cloud computing, devide a huge machine into multiple virtual machines
- terminology: host machine, virtualization layer(specialized os: app of this os is other os) / vmm / hypervisor, guest vm(virtualize hardware), guest os
- implementation
    - emulation: run a compiled os on a diff. hardware/ diff. ISA; translate / interpretate each instruction to the target environment; slow
    - virtualization: check if an instruction can run w/o interpretation or slightly modify instruction, or run virtualizd/specified/modified os
- e.g. mac running Windows
- programming interface on top of guest kernel, which donot interact directly with the hardware
