#### mass storage systems

solid-state disks
- faster for no need to move disk head
- more expensive
- convenient for random access

magnetic tape
- slower than magnetic disk
- cheap
- used for backup

disk structure
- sector 0 being the first sector of the first track on the outermost cylinder
- disk scheduling: whihc request to serve when one request being served
- FCFS
    - fast, easy to implement
- SSTF
    - serve the nearest request
    - possible starvation
- SCAN
    - just scan
- C-SCAN
    - move only one direction
    - more fair
- C-LOOK
    - only goes to the last request in each direction

error detection and correction
- parity bit: check sum(xor of all bits, not able to detect two bits error)
- CRC: use hash function to detect multiple bit errors
- error correction code: detects and correct some errors

disk management
- RAID
    - 0: no redudency stripping
    - 1: mirrored disks
