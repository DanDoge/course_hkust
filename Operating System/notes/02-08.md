### intro

virtualization
- replace the os with vmm or hypervisor, diff. between these two are negligible
- VMvare / Virtual Box -> called vmm; but in commercial cases, no host os, just a virtualization layer; hypervisor: e.g. run windows on macos
- similar to emulation but complicated
- host -> vmm > guest vm(with devices even not on the host machine) -> guest os
- perform isolation on one physical server, diff. services on one physical machine
- hypervisor provide an illusion that programmer / even os cannot tell whether on a vm or a physical machine
- cloud computing
    - like gas, electricity, water;
    - request: user -request-> web server -forward-> data center -select a physical machine-> hypervisor, create a machine as requested, send back an aknowledgement
    - types: public / private / hybrid
        - public: azure, google cloud; vm and other services to public user
        - private: only availble to small number of people, internal users; security, privacy
        - hybrid: some resources private, e.g. storage
    - SaaS / PaaS / IaaS
        - software: e.g. dropbox; only access to a specific software; easy to use but not flexible
        - platform: e.g. app agent(?), providing programming interfaces / apis / libs
        - infrastructure: provide the vm; storage, libs, os left to users;
        - easy to use / cost(money): s > p > i; flexiblity: i > p > s;
    - structure: website(say, where user choose the data center), request accepted by costomer interface, forward to cloud manager(the data center user chose), select a server availble, done; optional: load balancing, file policy

kernel data structures
- single linked list
- doubly linked list
- circular
- binary search tree
- hash function / table
- defined in include files

### os structures

two type of os services
- user facing os services
    - user interface, cli / gui / batch / touch-screen
        - cli / command interpreter: implemented in kernel / system program; shells; type in command and parameters, interprete then executed
        - gui: mouse, keyboard; icons; multiple guis in linux
        - touch screen
    - program execution: understand how to run a program, and how actually runs it
    - io operations: read / write, io devices interact with the os
    - file-system manipulation: e.g. ios no file system explicitly to users, but has a file sustem
    - communications: e.g. web, email, ftp; between diff. machines or diff. processing(ipc)
    - error detection: dead lock, file, mem., kernel
- internal services: not visible to end users
    - resource allocation: multiple users / processes, no starving
    - logging / tracing: track users resource, program information; for system operators
    - protection and security: programs do not interfere, hacker attack
- sandwich: user / system programs --- user interface --- system service(userfacing | internal service) --- os --- hardware

system calls
- load a program is also a system call: load and exec
- e.g. cp files: print request -> input src / dst file name -> read file name -> open file | error checking -> print error message | loop: read data blocks -> write to output file -> reach the end -> close files -> print final message -> done
- language provides high level apis(written in C or something else), but low level in machine codes; e.g. printf function; include some lib provided by os; e.g. read, #include <unistd.h>
- return value: 0 success, non-0 error
- win32 api posix / jvm api; system calls hard to use, and vary from diff. systems and diff. versions
- narrow waist, sys call interface, seperates user and system
- implementation: syscall assigned an ID, os maintain a table of id and implementation(pointer)
- syscall interface: intercepts function calls in the API, invokes syscall in os kernel, return status and return value
- parameter passing
    - registers, size and length limited
    - block method, pass the address of the parameter block in a register
    - stack method, push parameter in sys. stack, pop in syscall
