### virtual memory

working-set model
- delta = a fixed number of page references
- too small -> not encompass entire locality
- too large -> encompass several localities
- D = sum of WSS (WSS: working set, total number of pages referenced in the most recent delta)
    - approximation of current locality in the system
- D > m: at least one process is short of memory
- keeping track of working set
    - reference bits for each page: e.g. (0, 0) being not used, (1, 0) being referenced once, (1, 1) being used twice
    - copy and set all reference bits to zero when timer interrupt
    - more reference bits for more accuracy
- establish acceptable page-fault frequency rate
    - loses frame if PFF too low
    - gains frame if PFF too high
- migrate from one locality to the next locality -> working set change over time
- allocating kernel memory
    - kernel process: more requirements(less than a page, multiple contiguous pages)
    - buddy system: power of 2 allocator
        - e.g. kennel demands 21KB, split 256KB contiguous memory into 128, 64, 32, then give one 32KB memory to the kernel
        - internal fragmentation
    - slab allocator
        - slab: one or more physically contiguous pages
        - cache: one or more slabs, each cache conbines with a kernel structure
        - no internal fragmentation, fast allocation
        - a slab has three possible states: full, empty, partial
        - slab allocator: attemps to use free object in a partial slab, then empty, then allocates a new slab

other considerations
- prepaging
    - reduce page faults at process startup
    - waste IO and memory if prepaged pages not used
- page size
    - too small, large pagetable; too big, internal fragmentation
- TLB reach
    - the amount of memory accessible from the TLB = TLB size * page size
- progeam structure
    - loop order

### mass storage systems

hard disk drives
- rotate, specified in RPM
- positioning / random-access time: move disk arm to desired cylinder, plus the time for desired sector to rotate udner the dist head
- IO bus
- average seek time: 1/3 of tracks
- average latency: 1/2 latency
- seek time and latency dominate access time
