### processes

recap
- ipc models: shared memory, message passing
- shared memory: coordinate processes -> synchronization, controlled by user processes
- message passing: send, receive system call, os controlled
- producer-consumer problem

producer-consumer code
- synchronization issue: context switch just after boundry check, and pointer to boundry changed later

message passing model
- P sends a message to an end point, and then handled by os
- os should establish a communication link between two processes
- issues
    - links: socket? pipe? file?
        - physical: shared memory, hardware bus, network
        - logical: direct(link to a perticular process)/ indirect(send to a mail box), synchronous(blocked) / asynchronous
    - can a link associated to more than two processes?
    - each pair of processes, how many links?
    - capacity of a link?
    - size of message fixed or variable?
    - unidirectional or bi-directional

direct communication
- send(P, message), receive(Q, message)
- a link associated with a pair of process
- one link between each pair of process
- usually bi-directional

indirect communication
- each mailbox has an id
- process can communicate iff they share a mailbox
- more than two processes
- link established iff process share a mailbox
- establish multiple links between two processes
- uni/bi-directional
- operation
    - create, send(A, message), receive, destroy
- one sender, two receiver: who receives?
    - no more than one receiver
    - only one process to receive
    - select a arbitrary receiver, and notify the sender

synchronization
- blocking: synchronous
    - both send and receive -> rendezvous, trivial producer-consumer problem, no more than one item in the buffer
- non-blocking: asynchronous, e.g. receive, return a valid message or null

buffering
- queue of messages attached to the link
- three ways
    - zero capacity
    - bounded capacity, send wait until an availble slot
    - unbounded capacity

pipes
- like a conduit
- issues
    - uni/bi-directional
    - if two-way communication, half / full duplex
    - require a relationship between the communication processes
    - through network?
- ordinary pipe: accessed by process created it, parent and child
    - two ends, read-end: fd[0], write-end: fd[1]
    - unidirectional
- named pipe: accessed without a parent-child relationship
    - bi-directional
    - no parent-child relationship
    - cannot hold data

client-server system
- socket: abstraction of network io queue
    - one side of a communication channel
    - data taansfer like files
    - tcp/ip udp/ip
- hostname, ip address, port number(0-1023 well known, 1024-49151 registered, >49151 dynamic)
- server side: create a socket, bind to protocol & local address & port, listen, accept
- client side: create a socket, bind to protocal & remote address & port, connect,

```shell
mkfifo pipe
ls > pipe &
grep "foo" < pipe
```
