### processes

recap
- cpu switch
    - overhead: save running status into PCB, reload state from PCB
    - trade-off: how frequently should context switch
- dual mode
    - user mode: apps, std libs
    - syscall, interrupt, trap / exception
- process creation
    - tree structure
    - resource sharing
    - execution options
    - address space
    - unix examples
        - fork, exec, execlp, wait, exit(lp)
        - tricky example, 3^{10} processes has been created, one process creates two children in each iteration
        ```c
        int main(){
            for(int i = 0; i < 10; i += 1){
                if(fork()){
                    fork();
                }
            }
        }
        ```
    - windows example, different from unix, a new process loads a new program
- process termination
    - exit system call, via wait, child status data returns to parent
    - os wake parent when child terminates
    - deallocate all resource
    - abort() system call, force to terminate child
    - cascading termination, when parent terminates, all children are terminated, in some os
    - pid = wait(&status)
    - child terminates so fast that parent has not yet called wait() -> zombie
    - parent terminated without wait(), child process is an orphan, in \*nix, assigned as a parent

e.g. android process importance hierarchy
- foreground -> visible -> service -> background -> empty
- terminate process that are least important

e.g. chrome brower
- what if each tab has a single *thread*, one failure will affect all threads
- browser process: ui, disk and network io
- each tab has a single renderer process, render web pages
- plug-in process for each plug-in

interprocess communication
- shared memory or message passing
- shared memory
    - read, or write system calls
    - communication controlled by user processes not the os
    - major issue: synchronize
- mesage passing
    - send, and receive, can across a network
    - better performance in multicore system: one core the handle send and receive
    - direct and indirect communication
    - producer-consumer problem
        - producer produces infromation, which is to be consumed by consumer process
        - buffer, unbounder-buffer or bounded buffer
        - bounded buffer, only SIZE - 1 items stored
