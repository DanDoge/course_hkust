### process synchronization

background
- process execute concurrently
- may result in data inconsistency
- require mechanism to ensure orderly execution of processes
- e.g. producer-consumer problem -> critical section problem
    - race condition: multiple process access adn manipulate the shared data, and the outcome depends on the order of execution
    - critical section: where a process changing shared varibles
        - ensure when one process in critical section, no other may be in critical section, mutual exclusion
    - ask permission before entering the critical section

```c++
do{
    entry_section();

    // critical section

    exit_section();

    // remainder section
}while(true);
```

solution to critical section
- mutual exclusion: no other process can be in critical section
- progress: no process in critical section, and some processes are waiting to enter, the selection of process cannot be postponed indefinitely -> at least one will be selected
- bounded waiting: when one process waiting, the number of other processes entering critical section before this process enter is bounded -> one process will wait for a bounded time

critical section in kernel
- preemptive: not free from the race condition, more difficult in SMP architectures
- non-preemptive: run until kernel mode exits, free of race conditions

peterson's solution
- assume load and store are atomic
- apply to two processes
- flag: ready for executuion
- turn: whose turn to executing
- proof
    - mutual exclusion: both process trying to enter the critical section, flag[0:1] = [true, true], and turn = 0 and 1, not possible!
    - progress: suppose one process being waiting, it must enter the critical section next
- discussion
    - complex for more processes
    - code being different for different threads
    - busy waiting: the waiting process wasting CPU cycles

```c++
do{
    flag[i] = true;
    turn = j;
    while(flag[j] && turn == j);

    // critical section

    flag[i] = false;

    // remainder section
}while(true);
```

mutex lock
- acquire a lock before the critical section
- still busy waiting -> spinlock
    - one advantage: no context switch required

hardware synchronization
- atomic / non-preemptive
- test and set: return its oringinal value, set it to true
```c++
do{
    while(test_and_set(&lock));
    // critical section
    lock = false;
    // remainder section
}while(true);
```
