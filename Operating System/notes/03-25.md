synchronizaiton problems
- bounded-buffer problem: mutex, full, empty
- readers-writers problem: rw_mutex, mutex for first variation
    - different logic for reader and writer processes
    - read-writer lock: multiple process to read, up to one write
- dining-phiosophers problem
    - possible deadlock
    - mutex being not sufficient
    - monitor!
        - lock: up to one process in the monitor
        - conditional variable: x.wait() and x.signal(), waiting queue of conditional variable, x.signal() no effect if no process is waiting for the conditonal variable
        - hoare monitor: P give up the monitor and wait for process Q
        - mesa monitor: P keeps the monitor and continues execution, Q is placed on the entry queue
        - easy solution of the dining phiosopher problem

monitor implementation using semaphores
- variables: mutex, next, next_count, initialized to 1, 0, 0 respectively
- each external function F replaced by

```c++
wait(mutex);
    // F
if(next_count > 0){
    // other process in the entry queue enter the monitor
    signal(next);
}else{
    // releases the monitor
    signal(mutex);
}
```

```c++
semaphore x_sem;
int x_count = 0;
// x.wait
x_count++; // waiting in the x_waiting queue
if(next_count > 0){ // if other process waiting in the monitor
    signal(next); // first give the monitor to process in the entry queue
}else{
    signal(mutex); // then try to give the monitor to other processes
}
wait(x_sem);
x_count--;

// x.signal the hoare way
if(x_count > 0){
    // give up monitor if other process waiting for x_sem
    next_count++;
    signal(x_sem);
    wait(next);
    next_count++;
}else{
    // do nothing
}
```

solaris synchronizaiton
- adaptive mutex: starts like a standard semaphore as a spinlock, if the lock held by a thread running on another CPU, spins to wait for the lock, if the lock keld by a non-run-state thread, bokc and sleep waiting for signal of lock being released
- condition variables
- readers-writers lock

windows synchronizaiton
- spinlock: in the kernel, the thread holding the spinlock will not be preempted
- dispatcher objects: outside the kernel

linux synchronizaiton
- disable interrupts prior to version 2.6
- pthread API: mutex locks, condition variable, (read-write lock and spinlock being non-portable)

deadlock
- system model: resource r_1, ..., r_m, each has w_i instances
- deadlock characterization
    - necessary but not sufficient
    - mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption, circulat wait
