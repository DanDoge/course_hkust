### scheduling

reason: interleave the CPU burst and IO burst of multiple threads

criterias
- throughput
- waiting time / turnaround time
- response time
- fairness

algorithms
- FCFS
    - waiting time not garanteed
- RR
    - take turns to run each tasks
    - size of time quantum affects the performance
    - RR always better than FCFS?
        - jobs: 100, 100, ..., 100
        - time quantum being 1
        - average completion time worse under RR
    - bad when all jobs have the same length: divide the CPU into n small CPUs, running n times smaller, fair but performance worse
    - turnaround tiem varies(randomly) with different time quantum: rule of thumb, 80% of the CPU burst should be shorter than the time quantum q
- SJF
    - sort all jobs by their CPU burst time, schedule the process with the shortest CPU burst
    - optimal for waiting time: given the CPU burst time given
    - moving average / exponential average: tau_{n + 1} = at_{n} + (1 - a)tau_{n}
        - t_{n} actual length of the n-th CPU burst
        - tau_{n} predicted value of the next CPU burst
        - expand the formula, the effect of history being smaller(exponentially) as time goes by
    - non-preempted
- SRTF
    - preemption version of SJF
    - estimate the running time
- comparision of SJF/SRTF and FCFS
    - first two being optimal(proven), SRTF at least as good as SJF
    - if all process have same CPU burst time, these algorithms perform the same
    - but SJF/SRTF can lead to starvation / unfair: short jobs keep coming
- priotiry scheduling
    - a priotiry number associated with each process
    - still possible lead to starvation: aging! priotiry increase as time progresses
    - with RR: RR within the same priority
- multilevel queue  
    - assign a priority number to each queue
    - in each queue: SJF, RR, ...
    - preemptive or non-preemptive version
    - or give different time to each CPU process time
- multilevel feedback queue
    - no need to know CPU burst time
