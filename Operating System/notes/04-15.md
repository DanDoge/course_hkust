paging hardware
- CPU: p + d, frame number + offset, go to page table to find physical frame start address -> f + d
- two memory access: page table, physical memory
- TLB: translation look-aside buffers, cache a subset of page table
- valid-bit in a page table
    - e.g. Intelx86 page table entry
- hierarchical page table
    - page table too big to fit in one page
    - 10bits for each hierarchy, s.t. one page table is of 1024 * 4bytes long, fit into the 4Mb page
    - more memory access
- hashed page tables
    - linked list in each hash table entry
    - # of memory access depends
- e.g.
    - Intel IA-32
        - both segmentation and paging
            - segmentation: friendly to users, easy to share address
            - paging: friendly to OS, no external fragments
        - each segment being 4G, up to 16K segments(2^14) per process
        - first partition segment being private, second partition shared among all process
        - 13 + 1 + 2: 13 + 1 for segment number, 2 for protection
        - each segment divided into pages
        - translate segment number to page number, then translate to physical address

### virtual memory management

background
- not all the code necessary to brought into memory to execute
- execute partially-loaded programs
- virtual memory
    - on-demand allocation
    - logical address space larger than physical address space
    - less io to load and swap processes

demand paging
- bring into memory only when needed
- lazy swapper: swap a page unless it is needed -> pager
- valid bit to check whether a page in a memory resident
- page fault: invcalid reference -> abort or just  not in memory -> load the page
- extreme case: strat process with no pages in memory
- free frame list: add a frame to the list, zero-fill it only when a new process request it
