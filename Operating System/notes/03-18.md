### process synchronization

race condition
- several process acess and manipulate the same data item
- critical section problem
    - make sure only oen process running in the critical section
    - solution: mutual exclution, progress, bounded waiting
    - critical section problem in kernel: kernel code, queue, files
        - approach: preemptive(race condition!) / non-preemptive(low use of resources)

peterson's solution
- two process, load and store are atomic
- set flag[i] = 1, turn = j, then checking: flag[j] && turn == j, set flag[i] = 0 after leaving critical section
- proof
- drawbacks: complex, different code for different process, busy waiting

mutex locks
- acquire(), and release(), calls to these must be atomic
- busy waiting! spinlock

hardware synchronization
- test and set: return its original value, set t to be true
    - solution using test and set: while(test_and_set(&lock)); critical section; lock = false;
- compare and swap: if value == expected, change it to new value, return the oringinal value
    - solution: while(compare_and_swap(&lock, 0, 1)); critical section; lock = 0;

semaphore
- non-negative integer variable
- wait() and signal() / P() and V()
- wait: busy checking for S<=0, then S--, signal: S++
- counting semaphore: counting the number of data items
- binary semaphore: similar to mutex locks
- implementation with no busy waiting
    - associate each semaphore a waiting queue
    - two operations: block, wakeup
    - semaphore value may be negative, its magnitude being the number of processes waiting for the semaphore

deadlock and starvation
- two or more process waiting indefinitely waiting for an event caused by one of other waiting process
- priority inversion
    - H > M > L, H waiting for resource R used by L, when M become runnable, it will preempt L.
