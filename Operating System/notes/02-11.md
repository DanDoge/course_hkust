#### announcements

- lecture videos: 3-4 days after
- tutorials: starts this week(on linux)
- homework 1: end of this week, due 4 mar.

#### os structures

recap
- ui provided by os: gui, touch screen, command line; interact directly with users
- system services invoked by system calls(an bridge between system and user, user facing layer)
    - user facing: program exec., io, file, communicaition, error
    - internal services: resource, accounting, protecting; os to manage its own resource
- device facing layer: facing device driver / controllers
- api: hide the implementation / details from programmers, provide a. abstract, uniforming interface
    - parameters
    - return value: 0 success, -1 error
    - narraw waist
- system call implementation
    - sys. call no. and pointers to their implementation form sys. call table
    - sys. call seperate the os into two modes: user mode and kernel mode, trap into kernel mode by system calls, return to user mode after system call
    - only os has access to io devices
    - parameters passing: registers(but parameters could be more / larger than registers) / block mothod / stack method

type of system calls
- process control
    - create / terminate / end, abort / load, execute / set, get process attributes / wait for time / wait for specific event / allocate, free memory / dump memory / debugger, single step execution / locks
- file management
    - create / delete / open / close / read / write / get, set attributes
- device management
    - request, release,  read, write, set, get attributes
    - attach(e.g. mount in linux)
- information maintenance
    - time, date
    - sys. data
- communicaition
    - connection
    - massage passing
- protection
    - control access
    - get, set permissions

examples
- windows: camel naming, unix: single words, abbr.
- library call printf() calls system call write(), trap into kernel mode, return value to program
- arduino: embedding system, single tasking, boot loader starts first, and loads user program, when finished, reload shell
- freeBSD: unix varient, support multitasking, invoke shell when user login, shell creates process by calling fork(), and exec() to load program, shell waits / continues; kernel in high memory, interpreter -> shell, return 0 fine, non-0 error

system programs / system utilities
- ls, ps
- ui for system calls or more complex
- shape users' view of os
- file management(e.g. finder in macos), status information(e.g. ps), file modification(e.g. vi), programming-language support(e.g. gcc, gdb), program loading and execution, communicaitions, background services / deamon(launch at boot time, e.g. online chatting, in user context), app programs(not a part of os)

linkers and loaders
- \*.c -gcc-> \*.o, object file, which is not executable, -linker-> file which can be run -loader-> determine memory address / relocation
- some program cannot run alone, need libraries
    - all-in-one program contains all the libs, ok but big
    - dynamically linked libraries(e.g. dll), small program, no need to re-compile when library update, load once and used by all programmers
- e.g. main.c -> main.o(can execute, but need helper); helper.h, helper.c -> helper.o(not executable); link them to file *main*; shell > ./main, load main to some memory address, then execute main; or write all them into a makefile

```c
//main.c
#include "helper.h"

int main(){
    helper("Hello world!");
    return 0;
}

//helper.h
#include <stdio.h>

void helper(char* s);

//helper.c
#include "helper.h"

void helper(char* s){
    printf("%s", s);
}
```

protection
- from malicious use
- os goals: reliability / security / privacy / fairness(evenly allocate resources to diff. users)
- primary mechanism: address protection, limit the translation from program address space to physical memory space
    - can only access its own address space
    - implemented by translating program: mapping programming address into physical address
    - loader load diff. programs into diff. address spaces
- privilege level, ownership of files, access right

security
- robust from malicious uses outside or inside
- distinguish among users, userID associated with files
- group ID
- privilege escalation; chmod, chowner

os design and implementation
- not science but art
- from users' perspective: convenient, easy to learn, reliable, safe, efficient
- from system's perspective: easy to design, implement, maintain, flexible, reliable, efficient, error-free
- trade-off between the above two
- policy(what will be done) and mechanism(how to do it)
    - policy: check users' privilege to run
    - mechanism: how to implement this policy
    - seperate these to make implementation easier
    - policy widely accepted, mechanism not unified

implementation
- assembly language in early days, hardware dependent, not efficient to hardware changes
- c/c++ nowadays, hybrid with assembly lang.
- device driver: assembly language, itself is a hardware specific
- system in java, more higher lang., portability but not efficient
- emulation: run on a non-native hardware

structure
- no the best structure
- various ways to structure
