grading
- 8 labs, Q&A graded
- homework, written, 4*5%
- proj. 25%
- mid 20%, 25/05 19-21
- final 35%

comp. sys.
- hardware. cpu, mem, io
    - disk / mouse/ etc -> driver -> os kernel, which runs in CPU, results in memory
    - fetch instr., decode instr., fetch data, exec, write back; DMA
- operating sys. control hardware, and provide api to apps
    - data transfer handled by cpu, each device has a local buffer, when full, send a signal/interrupt to cpu
    - interrupt driven, interrupt handler; trap/execption: software-generated interrupt
    - kernel passively interact to interrupts
    - io request from os, activate io device -> transfer done, send interrupt -> interrupt signaled, os processing interrupt -> handled, resume from stopping point
- app
- users, contact with apps and os(mkdir, etc)

storage
- bit
- 1 byte = 8 bits
- 1 word = 8 bytes in 64-bit computers; depends on cpu architecture
- primary storage, volatile, directly accessed by CPU
    - random access, typically dram
    - caching
- secondary storage, nonvolatile memory(ssd/usb)
    - hdd, divided to tracks, sectors
- tertiary storage, rom
