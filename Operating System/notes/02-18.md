### processes

recap
- address space: stack, heap, data(initialized, uninitialized), text
- states: new, ready, running, waiting, terminated
- process control block, forming a double linked list
- thread
- scheduling queues: linked list; hierachical schedulers
    - long-term scheduler: controls the size of candicante pool, garantee short-teem scheduler can run fast; process-mix: mix io-bound and cpu-bound process

midium-term scheduler
- which process should be swap out of mem or swap in
- swapped-out process: inactive process
- reason: ready queue grows quickly
- control the degree of multiprogramming

cpu switch
- when suspended: save state into pcb, load state from pcb of the new process
- context-switch time -> overhead, depends on the complexity of the os and pcb, hardware support

dual-mode
- user mode
    - app, shell, compilers, interpreters, sys. libs
- kernel mode
    - only entity has access to hardware, allocates resources
- mode bit
    - user bit 1, kernel mode 0
    - transparent to users
    - privileged instructions, determined by hardware manufacturers, only executable in kernel mode
- mode transfer
    - syscall
    - interrupt, timer(a kind of hardware, but can be controlled), io events; external asynchoronous events
    - trap / exception, software triggered, internal synchoronous; protection violation(seg. fault); rfi return form interrupt

multitasking in mobile sys.
- only one process to run
- e.g. ios, single foreground, multiple background(with limits)
- e.g. background process uses a service, resource consuming

operations on process
- process creation
    - a tree of processes, parent, children
    - assigned a pid by os when created
    - resource sharing options
        - share all resources
        - share a subset of resources
        - share no
    - execution options
        - execute concurrently
        - waits until children terminate
    - address space
        - duplicate the parent address space to child
        - new program loaded into it
    - unix example, create a copy of current process with a new pid
    ```text
    fork() -----------> wait()
    |               |
    |-> exec() -> exit()
    ```
        - return value: pid -> parent process; 0 -> child process; < 0, error, only return to parent, no child forked
- exec(), execlp()
- wait(), wait for a child to finish
- exit()
