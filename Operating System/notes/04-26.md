### virtual memory


effective access time: (1 - p) * memory access + p * (page fault overhead + swap page in + swap page out + restart overhead)

copy-on-write
- parents and childs share the same pages in memory
- zero-fill on demand
- vfork(): no copy-on-write version of fork()

no free frame?
- evict a page, but which one?
- page replacement
    - modify bit to reduce overhead of page transfers: only write back the modified pages
    - frame-allocation algorithm
        - how many frames to give to each process
        - which frame to replace
    - page-replacement algorithm
        - lowest page-fault rate on both first access and re-access
    - reference string: no neighboring

page-replacement algorithm
- FIFO algorithm
    - evict the first page brought into memory
    - Belady's Anomaly: more frames cause more page faults
- optimal algorithm
    - replace the page that will not be used for longest time in the future
- least recent used algorithm
    - replace has not be accessed in the most amount time
    - a counter associate with each page
    - stack approach
- second chance
    - a reference bit attached with each page
    -replace the page with its reference bit being zero
    - circular linked list implementation

allocation of frames
- mininumn number of frames to execute a program
- fixed allocation
    - equal / proportional
- global replacement / local replacement

thrashing
- page fault rate being high and CPU utilization being low
    - usually we will load more process to increase CPU utilization, further increase page fault rate
- locality model
- working set model
