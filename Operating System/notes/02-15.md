### os design and implementation

- policy: what will be done?
- machanism: how to do it?
- separation of these two is important principle
- early: assembly language -> algol -> c/c++; now a mix of languages

os structure
- simple structure
    - e.g. ms-dos
    - no well- defined structures; app -> sys. program -> ms-dos device drivers -> bios device drivers, while the first three can have direct access to bios device drivers
    - reason: simple systems, limited resources
- more complex, monolithic structure
    - e.g. unix, from academia
    - two separatable parts: kernel, system programs, for user should not directly access to kernel
    - kernel separated into interfaces and device drivers, easily extended
    - monolithic: kernel itself like a block
    - pros: little overhead in system calls
    - cons: big kernel difficult to implement and maintain
    - with modular design -> linux
- layered
    - divide os into layers, layer0(hardware) -> ... -> layerN(ui)
    - hiding information, easy to implement and debugging; difficult to construct layers
- microkernel
    - implement nonessential components as system or user-level programs instrad of kernel
    - smaller kernel

#### process

concepts
- process: instance of a running program, a address space, thread(s) of control
- address space: memory allocation only accessable to a perticular process
- therad: single unique execution context: pc, reg, flags, stack
- dual mode operation: system kernel can access to certain resources, protect os and hardware from user programs, user programs isolated from one another

process
- a program in execution: code/text section, program counter, registers, stacks, data section, heap
- program is a passive entity, while a process is active
- process executes in address space(diff. from physical mem. location)
- one program executer by several processes
- process state
    - new, running, waiting, ready, terminated
- process control block
    - process state, pc, reg, cpu scheduling information, mem-management info., accountign info., io status info.

threads
- unique execution context, min unit of executing program
- represented by pc reg, exec. flags, stack
- one for io, one for cpu, etc., fully utilze resources

process scheduling: maintain ready queue and wair queues, fair / low latency / fast

schedulers
- long-term scheduler / job scheduler, which process should be brought into ready queue / memory, determines the degree of multiprogramming/tasking, can be slow
- short term scheduler / cpu scheduler, which process from ready queue should be executed, must be fast
- io-bound process / cpu-bound process
