#### memory-manegement strategies

background
- program brought into memory and placed within a process
- main memory and registers being small
- memory unit sees a stream of addresses and r/w requests
- memory stall: waiting for data in the memory
- cache in betweeen

base and limit registers
- compare twice to check whether out of the range

address binding
- compile code addresses to bind to relocatable addresses
- linker or loader bind relocatable addreses to absolute addresses
- compile time binding: MS-DOS, compiler calculate all the addresses
- link or load time: compiler generate relocatable code
- execution time: binding delayed to when its execution, but need hardware support; easy to shuffle the memory / move code to another place in the memory
- address translation and protection
    - logical address: address used by the program and the CPU, also referred to the logical address
    - physical address: address on the memory
    - in compile and link or load time binding, these two address are the same
    - only in the execution time are these addresses different

MMU
- dynamic allocation using relocation register: better memory-space utilization, dynamic relocation support: load some code only at execution time
- swapping: when running out of main memory, swapped out some idle process, cannot swap frequently: low CPU utilization
    - swap only when memory is near full

memory allocation
- contiguous allocation: base register and lomit register, MMU allocate address dynamically
    - devide the memory into two partitions: hole and used
    - first-fit / beat-fit / worst-fit
- fragmentation
    - external fragmentation: total memory space satisfy a request but not contiguous
    - internal fragmentation: memory allocated to a process larger than requested
    - compaction: shuffle memory contents to place all free memory together, only possible if allocation is dynamic
    - other methods: segmemtation and paging
- segmemtation
    - logical address contains two tuple <segment no, offset>
    - segmentable: base and limit
    - segmentable base register(STBR) and segmenttable length register(STLR), the number of segments
    - multiple process share one segment
    - hard to find a best allocation strategy: change in size, hard to swap
