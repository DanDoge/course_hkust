system model
- multiple resources for each type
- each process holds multiple resources

deadlock characterization
- mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption, circular wait
- necessary but not sufficient

resource allocation graph
- request edege: process to resource(type)
- assignment edge: resource(instance) to process
- graph with a cycle does not necessarily lead to deadlock, except each resource has only one instance

handling deadlock
- deadlock prevention / avoidance
    - prevention: provides a set of methods to ensure at least one conditions cannot hold
        - mutual exclusion: less things to do with this
        - hold and wait: each process allcated all resources before begins execution, or request resource only when it has none -> low resource allocation, possible starvation
        - no preemption: request unavailable resource -> force it to give up all resource -> restarted when regain all resources
        - circular wait: impose a total ordering of all resource types, require each process request resources in an increasing order
    - avoidance: require additional information: which resources a process will request and using, the OS decide each resource request should (not) wait
        - each process declares the maximum number of resource
        - safe state: exists a sequance <p_1, ..., p_n> of all processes, s.t. p_i can request all resources
        - single instance for each resource type: resource-allocation graph
        - multiple instances: banker's algorithm(refer to 04-03.md for detailed information)
- detect and recover from deadlock
    - detect on the fly
- ignore deadlock, pretend never occur in the system
