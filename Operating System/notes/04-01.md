### deadlock

deadlock avoidance
- each process report its resources
- safe state
    - if exists an execution order, s.t. all processes' request can be satisfied
    - unsafe: deadlock may occur
- algorithm
    - single instance of a resource type
        - cycle in resource-allocation graph inplies deadlock
        - claim edge: dashed line, P_i -> R_j
        - claim edge -> request edge -> assignment edge -> claim edge
        - claim resource before execution
    - banker's algorithm
        - multiple instances per type of resource
        - declare a priori maximum usage
        - data structures: availble[m], max[n]\[m], allocation[n]\[m], need[n]\[m]
        - safety algorithm
            - work = availble, finish[i] = False
            - find an i s.t. finish[i] = False and need[i] <= work
            - work = work + allocation[i], finish[i] = True, go to 2
            - if finish[i] = True for all i --> safe
        - suppose wo have found p_0, ..., p_{i - 1}, then no process satisfies 2, then the algorithm outputs unsafe, but we have not iterated all possible execution sequence
            - proof that if banker's algorithm outputs unsafe, there does not exist a safe execution sequence
            - algorithm outputs unsafe: for all p_k, need[k] > availble + sum of allocation[l], l < i
            - suppose p_k is the first process in the hypothetical execution sequence that cannot execute in the safety algorithm

deadlock detection
- detect whether a deadlock occurred, and recover from the deadlock
- single instance of each resource type
    - maintain a wait-for graph: p_i -> p_j if p_i is waiting for p_j
- several instances for a resource type
    - availble[m], allocation[n]\[m], request[n]\[m]
    - detection algorithm: if allocation[i] = 0, finish[i] = true
