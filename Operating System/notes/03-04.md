### threads

threading model
- many to one
- one to one
- many to many
- two-level model

signal handling
- signal send to which thread?

thread-local storage
- like static data
- visible in different function calls
- may vary in different threads

lightweight process
- virtual CPU core
- bound to kernel thread
- provided by kernel library
- kernel prvovide upcall, handled to user thread library
    - upcall handler tell the kernel e.g. a LWP is running, pls allocate recources

Windows threads
- Windows API
- one-to-one mapping
- each thread contains
    - thread id, register set, user and kernel stacks, private data by DLLs
- data structure
    - ETHREAD: pointer to parent process, start address, pointer to kernel thread
    - KTHREAD: scheduling and synchronization infromation, kernel stack, pointer to thread evrivonment block
    - TEB: user space, tid, user stack, TLS

Linux threads
- refer to tacks
- using clone() system call
```c
int clone(int (*fn)(void* ), void* child_stack, int flags, void* arg, ...)
;
```
- flag: CLONE_FS, CLONE_VM, CLONE_SIGHAND, CLONE_FILES

### scheduling

maximize CPU utilization
- execution being CPU burst and IO burst mixing together
- overlap IO burst and CPU burst of diff. process
- distribution of CPU burst
    - large number of short bursts
    - small number of longer bursts

CPU scheduler
- select from the ready queue, allocate a CPU to oen of them
- decision when...
    - switch from running to waiting
    - switch from running to ready
    - switch from waiting to ready
    - terminates
    - scheduling above called nonpreemptive, scheduling when a ready process / CPU core, unless a process give up running
- preemptive
    - access to shared data
    - preemption in kernel mode
    - interrupt occuring during crucial OS activities

dispatcher
- gives control of the CPU to the process
    - switching context
    - switching to user mode
    - jumping to the user program

criteria
- CPU utilization
- throughput: number of processes completed per time unit
- waiting time: time waiting in the ready queue
- turnaround time: time to execute a partiular process
- response time: time from a request was submitted to the first response
    - time to echo a keystroke in editor
    - time to compile a program
- fairness

first-come, first-served
- convoy effect: short process stuck behind long processes

round robin
- one process for a small piece of time
- no process wait for more than (n - 1)q time
- response time: submitted time to the first time of context switch
