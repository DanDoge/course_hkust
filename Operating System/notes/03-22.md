priority inversion
- high priority process delayed indirectly by low priority process, even starve high priority process
- description by example
- solution: priority-inheritance protocol
    - temporarily raise the priority of procecss L

bounded-buffer problem
- n buffers, mutex=1, full=0, empty=n
    - mutex: only one process can access the buffer
    - full: # of items in the buffer
    - empty: # of empty slots in the buffer

```c++
do{
    wait(empty);
    wait(mutex);
    // add one item to bufer
    signal(mutex);
    signal(full);
}while(true);

do{
    wait(full);
    wait(mutex);
    // remove an item
    signal(mutex);
    signal(empty);
}while(true);
```

reader-writers problem
- reader: read but do not update the dataset, writer: read and write
- first readers-writers problem
    - only one writer process
    - no reader kept waiting, unless writer has gained access to shared data
    - solution
        - read_count: # of reader process in the critical section
        - rw_mutex: only one process accessing the shared data
        - mutex: protect read_count

```c++
do{
    wait(rw_mutex);
    // writing
    signal(rw_mutex);
}while(true);

do{
    wait(mutex);
    read_count++;
    // if signal(mutex) moved here, what would happen?
    if(read_count == 1){
        wait(rw_mutex);
    }
    signal(mutex);
    // reading
    wait(mutex);
    read_count--;
    if(read_count == 0){
        signal(rw_mutex);
    }
    signal(mutex);
}while(true);
```

variations
- first variation: no reader kept waiting, writer and reader treated equally, in a FCFS queue
- second variation: one a writer is ready, it neeeds to perform update asap

dining philosophers problem
- shared data
    - chopstick[5], shared data / rice
- problem
    - no two neighbours can eat simutaneously
    - deadlock

problem with semaphores
- incorrect use of semaphores
    - signal then wait
    - omit wait or signal
- deadlock and starvation

motivation for monitor
- semaphores for dual purporse
    - scheduling constraints and mutex lock
- better idea: locks for mutual exclusion and condition variables for scheduling constraints
- monitor: a lock and zero or more condition variables for managing concurrent access to shared data

monitor
- shared variables
- one process accessing the shared variables at a time
- predefined procedure
- condition variables
    - trigger or stall process
    - x.wait() or x.signal(): only for process in the monitor already
    - wait call will suspend the process if otehr process waiting for variable x, and it will be waken up later when other process executes x.signal()
    - each condition variable maintain a waiting list
- p: x.signal(), while q in x.wait() state, what will happen
    - hoare monitor: signal and wait, p gives up monitor and waits until q leaves the monitor
    - mesa monitor: signal adn continue: p keeps in the monitor and continues execution, q placed on the entry queue
- solution to dining philosophers
    - pickup: whether can pickup two chopstickes
